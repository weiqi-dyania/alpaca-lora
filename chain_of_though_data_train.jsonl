She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH/BSO) as the continuous bleeding was not responding to conservative measures and the patient had no further desire of fertility. Biopsy showed an infiltrate in the endomyometrium, fallopian tubes, and cervix of mature-appearing plasma cells that stained positive for CD56, CD38, CD79A, and MUM1 with lambda light chain restriction, consistent with plasmacytosis. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy demonstrated a hypercellular marrow and atypical plasmacytosis (25%) with lambda restriction. BM flow cytometry was positive for CD38, CD138, and CD19 and negative for CD56, CD20, and CD45 consistent with plasma cell neoplasm. FISH showed 46, female karyotype, positive for three copies of 1q21 including CKS1B gene. Free kappa and lambda light chain levels in urine were 39.9 (reference range 1.35\u201324.19) and 1.59 (0.24\u20136.66) with a kappa/lambda ratio of 25.09 (2.04\u201310.37). Free kappa and lambda light chains in serum were 12.6 (3.3\u201319.4) and 16.5 (5.7\u201326.3) with a kappa/lambda ratio of .76 (0.26\u20131.65). No M protein was detected in the SPEP or UPEP. The albumin level was 3.6, beta-2 microglobulin was 1.347 mg/L, and LDH was 163. The patient was diagnosed on 10th of December 2020 with nonsecretory multiple myeloma with extramedullary plasmacytoma (ISS stage I).\r\nAround the time of TAH/BSO, the patient also reported progressively painful swelling on the left side of her neck accompanied with odynophagia, dysphagia, and hoarseness. CT of neck showed a left thyroid mass (7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm) with irregular borders and a multinodular thyroid enlargement. Diagnostic incision biopsy demonstrated a very friable, irregular, malignant-appearing mass in the left lobe. A portion of the mass was removed and sent for analysis. Biopsy confirmed lambda-restricted plasma cell neoplasm involving the strap muscles. The neoplastic plasma cells were positive for CD138, CD79a, CD45 (dim), MUM1, VS38C, and CD56. The patient remained clinically and biochemically euthyroid.\r\nWhole body FDG-PET scan showed FDG uptake in a 4.4 \u00d7 4.7 cm mass with central necrosis within the left thyroid lobe along with mild FDG uptake within two right breast nodules. Breast U/S and mammography confirmed the nodules on the PET scan and showed other multiple bilateral nodules. Excision biopsy of the right breast nodule also showed lambda-restricted plasma cell neoplasm ( and ) positive for CD 56, CD138, CD79a, and VS38C. The patient also started complaining of lower extremity bone pain, but skeletal survey was negative.\r\nThe patient was started on bortezomib (Velcade), cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD). After the first cycle, lenalidomide (Revlimid) was added to the regimen (RVCD). The patient completed a total of 1 cycle of VCD and 4 cycles of RVCD. Follow-up PET-CT scan done 6 weeks after the 5th cycle showed no evidence of active lesions. The patient had a clinical complete response (CR), so she proceeded with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 8 weeks after the 5th cycle of chemotherapy with high-dose melphalan conditioning. The patient tolerated the treatment well. She will be continued indefinitely on daily lenalidomide and alternate weekly bortezomib maintenance therapy and will be followed up with PET-CT scans.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever been diagnosed with nonsecretory multiple myeloma?

In March 2013, he presented with a Gleason score 4+4 adenocarcinoma (cT3aN0M0) and was treated with ADT plus external beam radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy. In June 2018, he was diagnosed with CRPC, right after PSA levels increased to 11.8 ng/ml and received docetaxel 70 mg/m2 with prednisone 10 mg daily. In October 2018, after 16 cycles of docetaxel, the patient presented with biochemical failure, indicated by an elevated PSA level of 40.2 ng/ml. In 01/2022, abiraterone was given at the standard dose of 1000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Two weeks after treatment with abiraterone was initiated, the patient was transferred to our department, with a chief complaint of convulsive seizures. His blood pressure level was 90/65 and no abnormalities were noted on brain CT. Routine laboratory and endocrinology tests revealed mild liver dysfunction (AST 57 IU/L, ALT 68 IU/L) and decreased levels of potassium 2.1 mEq/l and cortisol 3.0pg/ml. The levels of serum potassium before abiraterone therapy were 4.5mEq/l. We determined that the convulsive seizure occurred as a result of hypokalemia associated with abiraterone therapy. He received potassium supplementation and increased the dose of prednisone to 25 mg/d following discontinuation of abiraterone. Furthermore, furosemide, which was used for a prolonged period because of protracted lower extremity edema, was also interrupted. Seven days after the supplementation therapy, the levels of serum potassium and plasma cortisol were normalized (5.0 mEq/l and 7.5 pg/ml, respectively). He was discharged today and was prescribed oral prednisone (20 mg/d).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) List all the PSA levels of the patient separated by comma.

She was referred to our hospital 8 days ago with severe acute pain in left lower limb, which developed 16 hours before, due to acute femoral thromboembolic occlusion. She had exertional dyspnoea NYHA class II with palpitation and was receiving warfarin, diuretics, bronchodilators and digoxin. Intravenous heparin 5000 IU was given at a referring hospital 2 hours prior to our procedure. Clinical diagnosis of acute femoral artery thrombo-embolic occlusion with scanty distal flow was confirmed with color doppler. Investigation showed haemoglobin of 16.5 g% with total leukocyte count of 11,400/ml, serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, International Normalised Ratio 1.61, Bleeding Time and Clotting Time 2.3 and 5.0 minutes, respectively, prolonged activated Partial Thromboplastin Time beyond measurement and serum K+ 5.2 meq/l. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation (AF) with ST-T changes, echocardiogram revealed AF without atrial thrombus, severe mitral stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2), grade II mitral regurgitation, severe aortic stenosis (peak pressure gradient/mean pressure gradient 75/51 mm Hg), severe pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient also had poor pulmonary function with room air saturation of 91%.\nThe patient was taken for emergency thrombo-embolectomy. A combined femoral sciatic nerve block was planned. In supine position, a 22-G, 2.5-inch nerve locator (INMED, locator, HN) needle was used for femoral block; posterior branch of femoral nerve was located (by patellar ascension, dancing patella). A mixture of 20 ml local anaesthetic (15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine + 5 ml of 2% lignocaine) was injected into the femoral sheath with a firm distal digital pressure. Fifteen minutes later, the patient had adequate pain relief. The patient repositioned laterally to perform sciatic block with the classic approach of Labat. Thirty milliliters of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected into the sheath of sciatic nerve using 22-G 10-cm needle (INMED, locator, HN) to identify the nerve eliciting motor responses of plantar flexion.\nAfter 20 minutes of sciatic block, the patient was totally relieved of pain and surgical embolectomy [Figures and ] was performed. Arterial and limb venous blood gas analysis was done prior to and following embolectomy. Total blood loss was 150 ml. Intravenous 2500 units of heparin was administered. Patient was monitored in postoperative ICU. An ultrasound (10 MHz, higher linear frequency probe, Acuson150, Seimens, California, USA) guided evaluation was carried out to rule out haematoma formation and compression on nerves at both sites, twice, till the complete motor and sensory recovery, which was after 7.5 hours.

COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. \nFINDINGS: The liver is enlarged with a heterogeneous appearance and a macronodular contour, likely due to known cirrhosis. The main portal vein as well as the right anterior and posterior, and left portal veins are patent with hepatopetal flow. The common hepatic artery is patent with normal arterial flow. The left hepatic, middle, and right hepatic veins are patent with appropriate directionality of flow, as are the inferior vena cava, superior mesenteric, and splenic veins. The gallbladder is nondistended and does not contain gallstones or sludge; however, there is notable gallbladder wall edema measuring 2.8 cm. Given the size of the liver and known hepatitis C. diagnosis, this may suggest an acute on chronic episode of hepatitis. There is a trace perihepatic fluid. The pancreas is incompletely visualized due to overlying bowel gas. The spleen is enlarged consistent with history of cirrhosis, measuring 21 cm. The right kidney does not demonstrate stone, masses, or hydronephrosis. The visualized portions of the aorta and inferior vena cava are of normal caliber. IMPRESSION: 1. Enlarged heterogeneous macronodular liver consistent with history of hepatitis/cirrhosis. 2.

The patient had a good performance status score according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, and started neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV, and 5FU 2400 mg/m2 IV by continuous infusion over 48 h, with dexamethasone 10 mg and ondansetron 12 mg IV as pre-medication). According to the schedule, irinotecan was administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 min immediately after oxaliplatin. Subcutaneous atropine (0.25 mg) was given for cholinergic syndrome prophylaxis. About an hour after the start of the irinotecan infusion, the patient developed slurred speech that quickly progressed to dysarthria. CPT-11 infusion was quickly interrupted and symptoms spontaneously decreased and then completely resolved in about 90 min. At clinical examination, he was conscious and alert, neither motor nor sensitive neurological signs were noted, and the patient did not report any other symptoms. Two hours later, we decided to restart the infusion of irinotecan, slowing the infusion rate, without any adverse event. The second cycle was administered maintaining the same dose and with the same pre-medication, and the patient did not show dysarthria or other neurological symptoms. After the second cycle, he developed grade 2 thrombocytopenia according to the CTCAE  and he interrupted CPT-11, continuing the FOLFOX regimen. A partial response in the liver was shown; therefore, he underwent a partial hepatectomy.

Dermatological examination revealed a large desquamating erythematous lesion, well delineated, associated with slight edema and scratch signs on the right knee. Scattered erythematous papules coved by scales and diffuse erythema were noticed on the left knee and left lower leg (Fig. ). She described DSTG 1% gel application only on the right knee for 5 consecutive days. First complaints were noticed on the right knee, followed by occurrence of the same lesions on the left knee and left lower limb. The presumed mechanism of occurrence of the skin lesions on the other leg is transfer of DSTG 1% gel from right knee to other knee and id reaction. The application of DSTG was discontinued. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroid ointment (betamethasone) twice daily for 7 days resulting in complete regression of lesions. Clinical diagnosis of ACD to diclofenac sodium was confirmed by positive patch. A patch test was performed 5 weeks later and was positive only to the patient\u2019s own DSTG 1% gel (++/+++) and 1% diclofenac sodium in petrolatum (++/+++). Readings were done at Day 2 and Day 3.

In March 2013, he presented with a Gleason score 4+4 adenocarcinoma (cT3aN0M0) and was treated with ADT plus external beam radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy. In June 2018, he was diagnosed with CRPC, after PSA levels increased to 11.8 ng/ml and received docetaxel 70 mg/m2 with prednisone 10 mg daily. After 16 cycles of docetaxel, the patient presented with biochemical failure, indicated by an elevated PSA level of 40.2 ng/ml. In 01/2022, abiraterone was given at the standard dose of 1000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Two weeks after treatment with abiraterone was initiated, the patient was transferred to our department, with a chief complaint of convulsive seizures. His blood pressure level was 90/65 and no abnormalities were noted on brain CT. Routine laboratory and endocrinology tests revealed mild liver dysfunction (AST 57 IU/L, ALT 68 IU/L) and decreased levels of potassium 2.1 mEq/l and cortisol 3.0pg/ml. The levels of serum potassium before abiraterone therapy were 4.5mEq/l. We determined that the convulsive seizure occurred as a result of hypokalemia associated with abiraterone therapy. He received potassium supplementation and increased the dose of prednisone to 25 mg/d following discontinuation of abiraterone. Furthermore, furosemide, which was used for a prolonged period because of protracted lower extremity edema, was also interrupted. Seven days after the supplementation therapy, the levels of serum potassium and plasma cortisol were normalized (5.0 mEq/l and 7.5 pg/ml, respectively). He was discharged today and was prescribed oral prednisone (20 mg/d).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with castration resistant prostate cancer? (2) If so, when?

He was referred to our department on Feb 4 for the inspection of progressing anemia. He was suspected as LS due to his specific family history by having two cases of colon cancer within his second relatives. Whole-body examination revealed two foci of advanced stage of carcinoma in descending colon and stomach. A hypo-vascular mass in its size of 15 mm was also detected in S2 of liver. Pathological diagnosis using the biopsied samples and surgically resected specimens were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of descending colon, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of stomach, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver, suggesting the liver tumor would be metastasis from colon. 5-Fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of oxaliplatin was selected for this case because this case was highly suspected as LS. During postoperative surveillance, repetitive polypectomy for colonic adenomas was performed, one of which was a 10 mm tubular adenoma with severe atypia in the ascending colon.\nDetection of MSI was performed by Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. (Saitama, Japan) using a National Cancer Institute\u2013recommended panel of microsatellite markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) and additional markers (D2S136, D3S1067, TP53, D18S51). This analysis showed a positive result for eight markers (except D5S346), indicating a high frequency of MSI (MSI-high). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins of this patient\u2019s tumors were also performed. Monoclonal antibodies (MLH1: mouse monoclonal, clone ES05, MSH2: mouse monoclonal, clone FE11, MSH6: rabbit monoclonal, clone EP49, PMS2: rabbit monoclonal, clone EP51 {DAKO, Denmark}) were used for the present study. The IHCs of the descending colon cancer demonstrated abnormal nuclear staining of scanty MSH6, concurrent loss of MLH1 and PMS2, whereas the staining for MSH2 was positive. On the other hand, IHCs of the liver metastasis showed complete loss of MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 and the staining for MSH2 was positive. IHCs of the stomach cancer revealed negative staining of MLH1 and PMS2, whereas the staining for MSH2 and MSH6 were positive. Further investigation in IHCs of the colon cancer specimens from his father and brother were performed. Both of them showed the same staining pattern, as of this patient\u2019s stomach cancer.\nA gene mutation of MLH1 was suspected in this family line, because all of the colon cancers demonstrated complete defects of MLH1 and PMS2. Genetic analysis for mismatch repair genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MSH3, PMS1, EPCAM, MLH3, APC, MUTYH, POLD1, POLE, TP53, AXIN2 and BMPR1A was conducted. This genetic testing revealed a frame shift mutation in codon 618 (c. 1852-1854delAAG / p.Lys618del) of MLH1. This mutation is registered on the database of InSiGHT as class 5 and as pathogenic in Clin Var. To investigate the mechanism of the scanty staining pattern of MSH6 in colorectal carcinoma, analysis of the coding region microsatellite (C)8 in exon 5 of MSH6 in this patient\u2019s colon cancer, stomach cancer, and liver metastasis was performed. An intact (C)8 region was shown in a normal tissue of the colon and stomach cancer. An abnormal (C)8 region was seen in the colon cancer and the liver metastasis. The distribution of the mutant alleles in the (C)8 tract was further analyzed by cloning and sequencing analysis. Deletion mutation (\u22121wt) and insertion mutation (wt + 1) were detected in the liver metastasis.

Contrast was not given due to misinterpretation\r\nof the protocol, at the time of performing the study.\r\nFINDINGS:\r\nThere are several areas of altered signal intensity in the lumbar vertebral\r\nbodies, consistent with metastatic involvement.  There is also involvement of\r\nthe sacral body and the right hemi-sacrum by metastasis, with extension\r\nthrough the sacral foramina.  This is however better evaluated on the MRI of\r\nthe hip done the day before, on 2022-2-14.\r\nAxial sections were obtained from L2-S1 level.\r\nThe metastatic lesions are  better seen on the axial T1-weighted images than\r\naxial T2-weighted images, which are limited by some motion.\r\nAt L4-5 level, there is a 2.1 cm area of altered signal intensity in the right\r\nside of the superior part of the L5 vertebral body, including the posterior\r\nmargin with possible extension into the spinal canal at this level.  In\r\naddition, there is a 1.3 x 0.7-cm focus in the right lateral recess, which\r\nappears to be contiguous with the above-mentioned metastatic focus in the L5\r\nvertebral body.  However, this was seen on the prior study on 2022-4-14, and\r\ninterpreted as disc protrusion.  On the present study, due to lack of IV\r\ncontrast, it is difficult to ascertain whether this represents disc material\r\nor tumor.  There is possible impingement/encasement of the traversing right L5\r\nnerve root at this level.  No pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue masses are\r\nnoted. The spinal cord ends at T12-L1 level.  The roots of the cauda equina\r\nare unremarkable.\r\nThe spinal canal at the T11 level, included on the uppermost aspect of the\r\nfield of view, appears unremarkable on the T1-weighted images and increased\r\n(Over)\r\n2022-2-15 7:45 PM\r\nMR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  \r\nReason: sacral bone metastasis right sciatica\r\nFINAL REPORT\r\n(Cont)\r\nsignal within the spinal canal on the sagittal T2-weighted images could be\r\nartifactual.\r\nIMPRESSION:\r\n1.

She referred to the emergency room due to an acute exacerbation of progressive back pain and neurogenic claudication. On examination, she had full muscle strength with some paresthesia in bilateral lower extremities. An MRI of the lumbar spine revealed grade 1 spondylolisthesis and severe canal stenosis at lumbar segment four/five (L4/5).\nShe underwent MIS TLIF at L4/5 with bilateral facetectomy and decompression without complication. Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential/electromyography were uneventful. Immediately, post-operatively, the patient\u2019s paresthesias and radicular pain resolved with full motor strength. On post-operative day 5, she reported subtle weakness (4+/5) which progressively worsened over the 24 hours. At this time, her examination demonstrated lower extremity areflexia, numbness, and weakness in bilateral lower extremities (graded 2-3/5). The patient also reported subjective numbness in bilateral upper extremities and episodes of dyspnea; however, her respiratory rate and upper examination were normal. She denied facial symptoms.\nShe underwent an MRI of the entire spine which revealed a cervical 3/4 cord compression and cord signal change and post-surgical decompression at the L4/5 level with instrumentation. The patient underwent lumbar puncture for cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis, revealing protein of 257 mg/dL (high), nucleated cell count of 1 cell/mcL, and red blood cell count of 24 cells/mcL. Given the examination and laboratory findings, she was diagnosed with GBS.\nThe patient was treated with five sessions of plasmapheresis. She experienced some improvement of her symptoms during treatment and was eventually discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. At three months of follow-up, the patient demonstrated significant improvement; she was ambulatory with a walker, without objective leg weakness, and only slight paresthesia of bilateral lower extremities. Her pre-operative pain remained resolved. She continued to progress and at her six-month follow-up, she was ambulatory without aid and without paresthesia.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient ever had surgery for breast cancer?

He had an aortic valve replacement with a metallic valve a few years ago and did not have any other cardiac risk factors and was fairly active. He took warfarin and his international normalized ratio (INR) was within therapeutic range. The day of the admission, he has been out the whole day and had not eaten or taken the usual amount of liquids; the initiating event took place at a funeral, where he felt nauseous and dizzy. This was in the evening time. At night, he went to operate the water pump and had an unheralded fall and recovered spontaneously. He was brought up to his room where he lay with head propped up. At that time, he felt a griping pain in the abdomen and experienced nausea and passed out. According to the wife, he came around with sprinkling of water. He complained of worsening of the gripe and felt like vomiting. By this time he was totally lying flat in bed. The wife witnessed his eyes rolling up and he had myoclonic jerks. He came around in a couple of minutes and was rushed to the hospital. On examination, he has normal range pulse and BP, while the rest of the exam was unremarkable. His ECG (sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block), blood work-up and echocardiogram were normal. His ejection fraction (EF) was 55% and the prosthetic aortic valve was functioning normally. His neurological assessment, electroencephalogram (EEG) and scan ruled out a neurologic cause (hemorrhage or thromboembolic event). He then underwent a HUT test, which came out positive at three minutes post nitrate provocation with a cardio-inhibitory response, where the ECG showed severe sinus bradycardia and sinoatrial (SA) exit block. He reproduced and confirmed all the clinical symptoms of an abdominal gripe, nausea, and sweating. He also felt like moving his bowel at the time. He was prescribed hydration, counter-maneuvers and walking. He did not have any recurrence in the follow-up period.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a thromboembolic event?

On exam, the patient was jaundiced, had abdominal tenderness, but no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Total bilirubin was elevated to 24.9 mg/dL (reference range 0.2\u20131.2 mg/dL) along with aspartate transaminase (AST) 176 units/L (reference range 5\u201340 units/L) and alanine transaminase (ALT) 108 units/L (reference range 0\u201355 units/L). Hepatitis B and C as well as HIV testing was negative. An MRI demonstrated no hepatomegaly and an atrophic spleen consistent with chronic SCD. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was notable for cholelithiasis and on his seventh day in the hospital he underwent cholecystectomy and cholangiopancreatography for removal of a common bile duct stone.\nOn day 10 in hospital, he continued to have increased total bilirubin with a peak of 80 mg/dL and also developed a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), 18.9 seconds (reference range 11\u201314.6 seconds). A presumptive diagnosis of SCIC was made, and on the same day the patient underwent RBCEx with a goal of 20% HbS utilizing six units of crossmatched-compatible red blood cells (RBC) which were C, E, and Kell phenotypically matched and SICKLEDEX\u00ae (Streck, Omaha, NE) negative on the COBE Spectra Apheresis System (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). His hemoglobin S level decreased from 44.4% to 17.8%. His laboratory markers improved, and the patient was discharged. Today is his 2-years follow-up visit and the patient has returned to his clinical and laboratory baseline without development of chronic SCIC.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient undergone a red blood cell exchange?

HPI: Mr. Quin's oncological history began in 2021 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA). He underwent radical prostatectomy on 06/2021 and salvage XRT in 2022. His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records. The patient recalls 37 treatments. The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 on 12/2021. He underwent a bone scan in 11/01/22 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 15/01 he had a PSA of 17.46. He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control. His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection. He is incontinent from his surgery. In 22/01 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation). The patient's LLP worsened. He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance. On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed. The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was sucking air in and out. ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup. MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues. No compression of the thecal sac. Mr. Quin reports improved pain since admission. He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther. he denies fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, LE weakness or paresthesia. He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on. The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Prostate Ca (history per HPI) HTN PVD ED Type 2 DM on oral agent Vocal cord polyp excision in 2018 H/o COPD \nMEDICATIONS: Bicalutamide 50 mg po qd Glyburide 10 mg po qd HCTZ 12.5 mg po qd MS Contin 30 mg bid Morphine 15 mg po q4h Senna Colace and lactulose prn constipation \nALLERGIES: NKDA \nSOCIAL HISTORY: Notary. CPA and lives with wife in Tonganoxie. Habits: 60 pack year smoking history Past heavy alcohol consumption but none now \nPHYSICAL EXAM: General: Well-appearing, in no acute distress. \nHEENT: PERRL. EOMI. Oropharynx is clear. Neck: Supple Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Cardiac: S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Chest: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds. old midline surgical scars. Extremities: Well perfused with no edema. No bony pain to palpation. Neurologic: CN II-XII grossly intact with no focal neurologic deficits. 5/5 LE strength, movements limited by pain. normal gait. toes down bilaterally GU: no penial or testicular abnormalities. +pads IMPRESSION and PLAN: 74 y/o gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, new L4 metastasis and pain. The patient's LBP is likely due to his spine met. Based on the MRI results, his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L-spine. I discussed with Mr. Quin the likely cause of his pain. We then discussed the treatment options. Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain. We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day. All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction. We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies. The patient only had L-spine MRI, a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease.

However, the findings on the study were discussed with Dr. Holmes.\r\nPRIOR STUDY:  MR of the lumbar spine done on 2022-4-14.\r\nTECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the lumbar spine was\r\nperformed without contrast.  Contrast was not given due to misinterpretation\r\nof the protocol, at the time of performing the study.\r\nFINDINGS:\r\nThere are several areas of altered signal intensity in the lumbar vertebral\r\nbodies, consistent with metastatic involvement.  There is also involvement of\r\nthe sacral body and the right hemi-sacrum by metastasis, with extension\r\nthrough the sacral foramina.  This is however better evaluated on the MRI of\r\nthe hip done the day before, on 2022-2-14.\r\nAxial sections were obtained from L2-S1 level.\r\nThe metastatic lesions are better seen on the axial T1-weighted images than\r\naxial T2-weighted images, which are limited by some motion.\r\nAt L4-5 level, there is a 2.1 cm area of altered signal intensity in the right\r\nside of the superior part of the L5 vertebral body, including the posterior\r\nmargin with possible extension into the spinal canal at this level.  In\r\naddition, there is a 1.3 x 0.7-cm focus in the right lateral recess, which\r\nappears to be contiguous with the above-mentioned metastatic focus in the L5\r\nvertebral body.  However, this was seen on the prior study on 2022-4-14, and\r\ninterpreted as disc protrusion.  On the present study, due to lack of IV\r\ncontrast, it is difficult to ascertain whether this represents disc material\r\nor tumor.  There is possible impingement/encasement of the traversing right L5\r\nnerve root at this level.  No pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue masses are\r\nnoted. The spinal cord ends at T12-L1 level.  The roots of the cauda equina\r\nare unremarkable.\r\nThe spinal canal at the T11 level, included on the uppermost aspect of the\r\nfield of view, appears unremarkable on the T1-weighted images and increased\r\n(Over)\r\n2022-2-15 7:45 PM\r\nMR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  \r\nReason: sacral bone metastasis right sciatica\r\nFINAL REPORT\r\n(Cont)\r\nsignal within the spinal canal on the sagittal T2-weighted images could be\r\nartifactual.\r\nIMPRESSION:\r\n1.  Extensive metastatic involvement of the lumbar vertebral bodies, body of\r\nthe sacrum and the right hemi-sacrum with extension through the sacral\r\nforamina.\r\n2.  L4-5:  1.4-cm focus in the right lateral recess, which could represent\r\neither disc material (as reported on  prior scans) or superimposed tumor. The\r\npatient should return for contrast-enhanced study, for further\r\ncharacterization.\r\nCOMMENT: Findings were discussed with Dr. Holmes\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient undergone an MRI?

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on January 10th, 2022 revealed a mass in the right renal pelvis, which was suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent an upper urinary tract endoscopy on January 18th, 2022, which confirmed the presence of a large, friable lesion in the right ureter, extending into the renal pelvis.\n\nHistopathological analysis of the biopsy samples obtained during the endoscopy on January 18th, 2022 revealed high-grade invasive UTUC, with infiltration into the muscular layer of the ureter. The tumor was staged as pT2.\n\nThe patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team, including urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists, and underwent a series of imaging studies and consultations to determine the best course of treatment. After discussion, the patient underwent a right nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection on February 2nd, 2022. The final pathology report on February 8th, 2022 revealed high-grade UTUC, with invasion into the muscular layer and peripelvic adipose tissue. A total of 8 lymph nodes were removed, with no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nPostoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home on February 10th, 2022. Follow-up surveillance with imaging and cystoscopy will be performed to monitor for recurrence or metastasis.\n\nIn summary, this patient presented with hematuria, flank pain, and fatigue, and was diagnosed with high-grade invasive UTUC on January 18th, 2022. The patient underwent a right nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection on February 2nd, 2022. Follow-up surveillance will be performed to monitor for recurrence or metastasis.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC)?

She has no comorbidities and no known family history of breast cancer. Initial treatment for stage II disease was right modified radical mastectomy followed by six cycles of adjuvant TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). The patient has received multiple lines of therapy for MBC, including vinorelbine plus trastuzumab at initial recurrence. After development of lung metastases in 2015, she was treated with T-DM1 on a clinical trial and experienced 4 years of disease control. She again experienced excellent disease control for 1 year with capecitabine plus lapatinib followed by slow progression of pulmonary metastases. Upon FDA approval of neratinib in combination with capecitabine for HER2+ MBC, lapatinib was replaced with neratinib 240 mg qd with continuation of the same dose of capecitabine (1000 mg bid) based on prior tolerability. The patient received prophylactic loperamide 4 mg tid but paused the regimen after 4 days because of grade 2 nausea and grade 1 to 2 constipation. She then reinitiated neratinib with a DE schedule, starting at 120 mg/day with prophylactic loperamide 4 mg bid, with improved tolerability. She was able to titrate the neratinib dose to 160 mg/day after 1 week, to 200 mg/day after 2 additional weeks, and to 240 mg/day by week 5. The patient was able to continue on therapy with loperamide bid with regular bowel movements and no further nausea. Three months into treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine, the patient had a near-complete radiographic response, with residual scarring in the areas of prior pulmonary nodules. She remains free of recurrent diarrhea.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Did the patient ever receive anti-EGFR mAbs? (2) If so, when was the starting date of the treatment with mAbs?

A digital rectal examination at the time did not reveal any masses or nodules. Ultrasound examination revealed an enlarged prostate (3.4 \u00d7 4.6 \u00d7 3.3 cm) and a normal bladder. He did not present any psychosocial disorders and no one in his family had been diagnosed with a tumor. A 12-core prostate biopsy revealed BCC in one-half of the prostate. A pathology report was obtained from the hospital where the patient was initially diagnosed. The prostate biopsy was immunohistochemically negative for PSA, alpha-methyl acyl-coenzyme A racemase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin; and positive for cytokeratin-903 (34\u03b2E12), p63, and Ki67 (<1%). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was normal indicating there had not been metastasis. This was confirmed by whole-body bone scintigraphy. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate BCC and was treated with a radical prostatectomy. The pathology report indicated local invasion of the nerve and thrombosis of tumor vessels; however, the margin and seminal vesicles were negative. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for PSA, alpha-methyl acyl-coenzyme A racemase, P53, cytokine 7 (CK7), and CK20 and positive for 34\u03b2E12, p63, and Ki67 (<1%).\n\nThe patient's TNM classification was pT2NxMx. To reduce the risk of metastasis, our patient received image-guided radiotherapy. The serum PSA level remained unchanged at 0.00 ng/mL before and after radiotherapy. The patient showed no evidence of disease progression until he was medically examined 2 years later. A chest CT scan revealed multiple lung nodules; however, bone scintigraphy showed no metastasis. A biopsy was performed on the nodules, and the patient was diagnosed with metastatic BCC of the prostate. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for PSA, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, androgen receptor, thyroid transcription factor-1, CD117, CD30, and octamer-binding transcription factor-4 and positive for 34\u03b2E12, P40, CK5/6, low molecular weight cytokeratin, and Ki67 (20%).\n\nInformation regarding the management and outcomes for BCC of the prostate is limited, and there is currently no standard treatment. We reviewed relevant literature to determine the optimal diagnostic and treatment methodology. Hormonal therapy is commonly administered; however, outcomes are poor. Considering that basal cells do not exhibit secretory activity, the patient received three cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel, but the tumor continued to grow, albeit slowly. Subsequently, we added cisplatin for another three cycles of chemotherapy. This treatment failed and the number of nodules in the patient's lungs increased. Therefore, next-generation sequencing of the patient's sample from a lung nodule was performed free of cost, which revealed mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily b-member 1 (SMARCB1), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) genes. The patient did not receive targeted therapy owing to his financial limitations and there were no clinical trials in which he could enroll. Currently, the patient's Zubrod/ECOG/WHO score is 1. Therefore, following approval by the ethics committee, the patient is scheduled to receive nine cycles of chemotherapy with etoposide (100 mg/day for 10 days, 4 weeks/cycle).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a bone scan?

Adjacent and separate to the left ovary is a well-circumscribed\nhypoechoic ovoid structure demonstrating some movement of internal echoes\nmeasuring 3.4 x 6.0 cm which either represents a loop of bowel or a dermoid.\nThe right ovary is not visualized.  There is a moderate amount of free fluid\nwithin the pelvis.\nIMPRESSION: 1. Intrauterine gestational sac and embryonic pole significantly smaller than\nprovided dates.  Internal echoes within the gestational sac along with declining \nbeta-hCG and clinical context are consistent with likely miscarriage. 2. Complex left adnexal mass, unclear of dermoid or bowel loop as etiology. 3. Moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  These findings may be\nrelated to volume overload and third spacing given patient's clinical history of myocardial infarction.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Is the patient pregnant at the time of the clinical note?

The day after hospitalization, the patient had abdominal pain. Approximately a month before, the patient was treated with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection with similar complaints. There was no family history of recurrent fevers. His physical examination showed a high temperature (39.2\u00b0C) with widespread abdominal tenderness, and rebound and defense positivity. To rule out an acute abdomen due to appendicitis, abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed; radiological findings did not suggest appendicitis. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL, white blood cell count: 7500/mm3, C-reactive protein (CRP): 141 mg/dL (0\u20135 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 88 mm/h, fibrinogen: 508 mg/dL (200\u2013400 mg/dL), d-dimer: 0.9 \u00b5g/mL, serum amyloid A (SAA): 4205 mg/L, serum creatinine 0.89 mg/dL, serum albumin: 4.17 g/dL, serum Fe: 17 \u00b5g/dL (32\u2013193), serum iron-binding capacity: 180 mg/dL, and haptoglobulin: 498 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, rheumatoid factor, and Brucella agglutination tests were negative. There were 225 erythrocytes/hpf and 3 leukocytes/hpf on urine analysis; the 24 h urinary protein was 708 mg/dL and the 24 h urinary microalbumin was 291 mg/dL. MEFV gene mutation analysis revealed homozygosity for the R202Q mutation.\r\nFMF was considered in the patient due to the presence of recurrent febrile serositis attacks and R202Q homozygous mutation in the FMF gene analyses. Colchicine was started 3\u00d70.5 mg/day by consulting rheumatology on day 8 of admission. The patient\u2019s symptoms were successfully controlled by administration of colchicine. On the 7th day of the treatment, the patient was discharged with colchicine treatment. After the colchicine treatment, there was a marked improvement in his complaints and the inflammatory markers returned to normal levels. At his follow-up visit at 6 months, the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient provided written informed consent to have the case details published.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever received colchicine?

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 2.4\u00d73.0\u00d72.5 cm mass located deeply in the left Sylvian fissure extending into the left temporal lobe. On both T2 and T1-weighted images, it was mainly iso- or hypointense, and enhanced brightly with contrast. The lesion appeared closely associated with the MCA and was surrounded by moderate edema. Preoperative diagnosis favored an intra-axial tumor, most likely a high-grade oligodendroglioma, which prompted the decision to utilize 5-ALA-induced tumor fluorescence as per standard.\r\nFour hours before the induction of anesthesia, 20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered orally. A left fronto-temporal craniotomy was performed, using intraoperative evoked potential monitoring. In order to ensure no interference, the entire operative field was initially assessed for fluorescence with a Leica M720 OH5 microscope equipped with FL400 Fluorescence Module. After dissecting the Sylvian fissure, a firm mass was exposed and its red fluorescence under the violet-blue excitation light was confirmed. It was not well demarcated from the surrounding brain parenchyma. The main mass was grossly removed using a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator under white light illumination. Guided by red fluorescence of the remaining tumor tissue, safe excision was achieved, while small areas of neoplasm with calcified portions were preserved due to their strong adherence to the MCA and the sylvian vein. The fluorescence in tumor was of helpful to delineate tumors from vessels which adjoined under same arachnoid membrane and enabled the safe resection without vessel injury.\r\nPostoperative MRI demonstrated the aforementioned unresected MCA-adherent neoplastic areas with calcification. Pathological examination of the fluorescent tumor specimen revealed a benign meningioma (WHO grade I) of psammomatous type. The patient recovered uneventfully without neurological deficits.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever received 5-aminolevulinic acid?

Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135-degree prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient's profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient's severe instability remained a challenge. Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a bone scan?

Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately. The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient\u2019s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation. Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient\u2019s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.\r\nRight internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins.\r\nA Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC. Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium. A Swan wire was inserted through the Swan-Ganz catheter. Then, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the Swan wire into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was successfully replaced with a Glidewire Advantage. Initially, a 9 \u00d7 80 Mustang balloon was used to perform the IVC ballooning; after IVC ballooning; however, the inferior venogram showed no flow to the IVC, which was still 100% occluded. Then, a 22 \u00d7 70 mm Wallstent was advanced via the right femoral vein to the right atrial side. The stent was deployed with a considerable waist in the mid area. After stent placement, an 18 \u00d7 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was successfully used to post-dilate the stent.\r\nThe final venogram and digital subtraction imaging mode showed excellent flow in the IVC to the right atrium. Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare. Usually, if IVC occlusion is of thrombosis in etiology anticoagulation is advised after venous stent placement, since our patient had an advanced liver failure with elevated INR, anticoagulation was not started.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient received immunotherapy on a date relative to the clinical note date?

Transvaginal ultrasound reveals a retroverted uterus which\nmeasures roughly 7.1 x 4.3 x 8.6 cm in size.  There are multiple masses\nassociated with the uterus. Several of these masses are hypoechoic and have\nthe appearance of fibroids.  Others are isoechoic and extend anteriorly and to\nthe left of the uterus. These may represent changes in relation with prior\nvesico-vaginal fistula. However, complete evaluation of this area was not\npossible. The endometrium is difficult to visualize and is distorted. Where\nseen, it measures approximately 3 mm in thickness.  No separate adnexal masses\nare identified. The right ovary was tentatively seen though neither ovary was\nidentified with certainty.

Flow cytometric analysis on the peripheral blood (PB) revealed 89.6% blasts by CD45/SSC gating. The blasts expressed CD10, CD19, CD34, HLA-DR, and CD20 (dim); partially expressed CD13, CD15, and CD33; and did not express CD2, CD7, CD56, and CD117. A subsequent bone marrow (BM) biopsy was done the next day but was a dry tap; therefore, flow cytometry and other cytogenetic studies were not performed on the BM sample. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were performed on the BM biopsy showing 95% blasts positive for CD79a, PAX-5, and TdT, and negative for CD20 and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The morphology and immunophenotype of the blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy were consistent with B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia. We did perform FISH analysis with a B-ALL panel on the peripheral blood specimen which revealed CDKN2A (p16 at 9q21) gene deletion on one or both chromosomes 9. Fusion of BCR and ABL1 was not detected. Intensive chemotherapy was initiated according to the CALGB 10403 \"Adolescent Young Adult\" regimen, and the patient achieved complete remission. He then proceeded to consolidation without consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) based on standard of care for B-cell ALL with favorable cytogenetic and molecular profile. However, the patient had prolonged cytopenias during consolidation therapy culminating in treatment delay. In early January of 2020 (approximately 24 weeks after initial diagnosis), the patient's complete blood count revealed 27% blasts. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on the PB; the blasts expressed HLA-DR, CD15, CD33, and CD117; partially expressed CD13 and CD56; and did not express CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, or CD34. A restaging BM biopsy was performed the same day; unfortunately, it was again a dry tap, so flow cytometric analysis could not be performed. The histology examination of the BM biopsy revealed a hypocellular (30%) marrow with 85% recurrent leukemic blasts. IHC showed the blasts were now positive for MPO, while CD10, PAX-5 CD20, CD79a, and TdT were negative. The overall findings on PB and BM biopsy were consistent with a lineage switch to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although it was a dry tap, a very small amount of aspiration specimen was obtained in the EDTA tube. Despite few marrow spicules on the aspiration smear, cytogenetic analysis and FISH studies were performed. FISH analysis with both B-ALL and AML panels showed persistence of a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion, plus the acquisition of a TP53 deletion, and 7q and 17q duplications. Cytogenetic studies now showed a complex karyotype in 18/20 metaphases, 47,X,-Y,add(1)(p36.1),+18,+add(18)(q23) [12]/47\u201348,X,\u2212Y,del(1)(p32p36.1),add(11)(p11.2),+18,+18[cp6]/46,XY. Intensive salvage chemotherapy was initiated with the MEC regimen, and nadir BM evaluation was hypocellular without blasts, although FISH demonstrated low-level CDKN2A deletion, consistent with minimal residual disease. Ten days later, a rising PB blast percentage prompted another BM biopsy which showed persistence of AL with the same phenotype and FISH with CDKN2A deletion. Further intensive chemotherapy was initiated.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Did the patient receive intensive chemotherapy?

There was no history of any opportunistic infection before the onset of skin nodules. Except arthralgia and mild constitutional symptoms, her general condition was fairly good and all her vitals were within normal limits. On examination, there were multiple, dusky red, large nodules and plaques over the feet, ankles, soles, shins, knees, and elbows. Majority of the lesions were non tender and symmetrically distributed. Few nodules over the soles were painful and ruptured with sero-sanguinous discharge. Some nodules over the shins healed with hyperpigmented macules. Inguinal lymph nodes on both sides were palpable and firm in consistency. There were no lesions elsewhere over the body and no mucosal lesions were present. Systemic examination disclosed no abnormalities. On ophthalmologic examination, there were no lesions in the eyes. Clinically, Kaposi's sarcoma or bacillary angiomatosis was suspected and the case was evaluated. \nLaboratory tests disclosed the following values: Hemoglobin, 10.4 gm/dl; total leukocyte count, 3600 cells/mm3; total red blood cell count, 2.70 million/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 80 mm/1st hour; reticulocyte count, 2.5%; packed cell volume, 29.4%; mean corpuscular volume, 108.9 fL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 38.5 pg; platelet count, 3, 21,000/mm3, differential count \u2013 59% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 7% eosinophils, 2% monocytes; serum glutamic oxalotransferase (SGOT), 48u/L; serum glutamic phosphotransferase (SGPT), 96 u/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 102 Iu/L; CD4+ count, 164/mm3; HIV RNA PCR (viral load), 666 IU/ml. Peripheral smear revealed macrocytic normochromic erythropoiesis and negative for immature cells. Mantoux test, serological tests for syphilis (VDRL, TPHA), hepatitis B and C, and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. Chest radiography and abdominal echography were normal. Two biopsies from nodule and plaque lesions were taken. Both specimens showed areas of ribbon-like thickening of collagen and areas with infiltrates of neutrophils and abundant neutrophilic nuclear dust. Few of the vessels showed features of vasculitis with fibrin in their walls. No proliferation of spindle cells was seen. Also, no vascular proliferation was observed. Based on histopathology, a diagnosis of EED was arrived at and the patient's blood was sent for estimation of serum IgA level which was 11.3 g/l (normal, 0.7-4). The patient was treated with oral dapsone 100 mg/day. After 2 weeks period, majority of the lesions resolved, but the patient developed hypersensitivity reaction to dapsone and the drug was withdrawn. After four weeks, colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily was given in place of dapsone. The response was slow and smaller lesions regressed, while larger lesions are in the process of regression. As the patient has low CD4+ count inspite of being on ART since seven years, she was referred to the nearest ART\u2013plus centre for second line therapy.

Clinically, Kaposi's sarcoma or bacillary angiomatosis was suspected and the case was evaluated. \nLaboratory tests disclosed the following values: Hemoglobin, 10.4 gm/dl; total leukocyte count, 3600 cells/mm3; total red blood cell count, 2.70 million/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 80 mm/1st hour; reticulocyte count, 2.5%; packed cell volume, 29.4%; mean corpuscular volume, 108.9 fL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 38.5 pg; platelet count, 3, 21,000/mm3, differential count \u2013 59% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 7% eosinophils, 2% monocytes; serum glutamic oxalotransferase (SGOT), 48u/L; serum glutamic phosphotransferase (SGPT), 96 u/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 102 Iu/L; CD4+ count, 164/mm3; HIV RNA PCR (viral load), 666 IU/ml. Peripheral smear revealed macrocytic normochromic erythropoiesis and negative for immature cells. Mantoux test, serological tests for syphilis (VDRL, TPHA), hepatitis B and C, and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. Chest radiography and abdominal echography were normal. Two biopsies from nodule and plaque lesions were taken. Both specimens showed areas of ribbon-like thickening of collagen and areas with infiltrates of neutrophils and abundant neutrophilic nuclear dust. Few of the vessels showed features of vasculitis with fibrin in their walls. No proliferation of spindle cells was seen. Also, no vascular proliferation was observed. Based on histopathology, a diagnosis of EED was arrived at and the patient's blood was sent for estimation of serum IgA level which was 11.3 g/l (normal, 0.7-4). On 2021-09-15 the patient started treatment with oral dapsone 100 mg/day. After two weeks period, majority of the lesions resolved. But the patient developed hypersensitivity reaction to dapsone and the drug was withdrawn. After four weeks, colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily was given in place of dapsone. The response was slow and smaller lesions regressed, while larger lesions are in the process of regression. As the patient has low CD4+ count inspite of being on ART since seven years, she was referred to the nearest ART\u2013plus centre for second line therapy. The second line therapy (atazanavir-based) was started in the month of November 2021.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Was the patient ever diagnosed with Erythema elevated diutinum?

Exfoliative cytology of the peritoneal lavage fluid during the operation was positive for adenocarcinoma (CY1). There was no metastasis to the liver. Microscopically, the tumor was a medullary type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma, infiltrating through the serosa (pT3) and involving regional lymph nodes (pN3; number of metastasis-positive per dissected lymph nodes, 9/23). Based on these surgical findings, the tumor was diagnosed as stage IV (pT3, pN3, sH0, sP0, sM0, CY1), and adjuvant chemotherapy combining 5-FU (total 150 mg), methotrexate (900 mg) and leukovorin (45 mg) was subsequently performed. One year after the operation, endoscopy showed a tumor in the jejunal pouch along the suture line, and examination of a biopsy specimen revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT demonstrated an intraluminal tumor in the jejunal pouch without any other recurrence. A course of chemotherapy consisting S-1 (2-week regimen) was feasible and repeated 10 times in an outpatient clinic. During the therapy, the recurrent tumor in jejunal pouch completely disappeared, and a biopsy revealed no remnant tumor tissue. The patient has now been well without any evidence of recurrence for 39 months.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Was this patient ever diagnosed with stomach  cancer?

He developed a biochemical recurrence of his prostate cancer in late 2016, around the time he was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, that included a brain metastasis in the Right occipital lobe s/p excision (7/2016, +V600E). In the context of his competing malignancy, he was started on Lupron monotherapy. He subsequently developed metastatic disease with numerous bony lesions seen on PSMA PET (10/2018 - mi T0 N0 M1b(diss)) and Xtandi was added. He had a biochemical response to Xtandi until this year when PSA has started to increase again, 2.1 (6/3/20) -> 4.2 (9/2/20) -> 5.6 (10/14/2020) -> 9.3 (11/23/2020)\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) List all PSA levels of the patient in the order that they are mentioned in the note, separated by comma.

Cirrhosis was well compensated, without ascites or edema before and during therapy. Pretreatment laboratory evaluation revealed albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 115 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 120 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 191 U/L, total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL, hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL, platelet count 183,000/\u03bcL, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load 3,210,000 IU/mL. Upper endoscopy was negative for varices. Therapy was complicated by anemia requiring ribavirin dose reduction and erythropoietin therapy and rash that resolved after discontinuation of telaprevir. Viral load was 110 IU/mL at treatment week three and undetectable at week eight. PEGylated interferon and ribavirin were discontinued after 48 weeks of therapy. HCV viral load remained undetectable from week eight until the end of therapy. Laboratory evaluation at week 45 revealed albumin 2.7 g/dL, AST 125 U/L, ALT 67 U/L, total bilirubin 1.3 mg/dL, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count 49,000/\u03bcL. Weight at the end of therapy was 132 lb (60 kg). One month after discontinuation of therapy, the patient presented with 5 lb weight gain (weight 137 lb) and new-onset ascites. Evaluation revealed albumin 3.1 g/dL, AST 77 U/L, ALT 44 U/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 8 mg/dL, creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet count 105,000/\u03bcL, and virologic relapse with HCV viral load of 228 IU/mL. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cirrhotic morphology, abdominal ascites, and recanalization of the umbilical vein and left retroperitoneal varices consistent with portal hypertension. The patient refused diagnostic paracentesis. An echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions and right ventricular systolic pressure, with no sign of pulmonary hypertension. Ascites rapidly responded to sodium-restricted diet and diuretic therapy (spironolactone 50 mg, furosemide 20 mg daily). Repeat laboratory evaluation after control of ascites revealed an albumin level of 3.9 g/dL. Repeat viral load 3 months after the end of therapy was 528,810 IU/mL.

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.\nHer physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient\u2019s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0.

If the answer to a question cannot be determined by the clinical note, use \"NA\" as the answer.\n\n### Input:\n<ClinicalNote>\nNote Date: 2021-02-21\nNote Text: The patient is a 50-year-old man with a 10-year smoking history and a family history of lung and colorectal cancer. In April 2019, he experienced intermittent macrohematuria. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed an irregular mass measuring 3.0 cm \u00d7 2.1 cm located at the anterior wall of the bladder. In early May, diagnostic transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) indicated that the tumor was cauliflower-like with broad base. The pathology revealed that the tumor was MIBC. As the chest/abdominal/pelvic CT scans indicated that the perivesical fat was invaded, the patient was diagnosed with clinical stage III-A (cT3bN0M0) bladder cancer.\nThe tissue sample collected during TURBt had a purity of 65% and was submitted for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using a 642-gene panel. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 19.10 Mutants/Mb and the microsatellite state was stable (MSS). Furthermore, inactivating mutation in the RB1 gene was detected. The immunohistochemistry showed that the combined positive score (CPS) of the PD-L1 expression level was <1, as determined by using a monoclonal mouse anti-human PD-L1 clone (22C3) antibody, and the frequency of infiltrating CD8+ T cells was 2%.\nConsidering the promising efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for patients with advanced bladder cancer and the high pCR rate in MIBC-related research, the patient strongly requested neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy.\nSince May 14, 2019, the patient received the neoadjuvant treatment, which included four cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) plus concurrent pembrolizumab. The regimen consisted of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8, cisplatin (60 mg/m2) on day 2, and pembrolizumab (200 mg) on day 2. As a grade 3 adverse event of bone marrow suppression arose, the gemcitabine and cisplatin doses were decreased to 850 mg/m2 and 50 mg/m2 in the following cycles. After two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, pelvic MRI showed that the thickness of the anterior wall of the bladder was lessened, and the thickest area was only 0.5 cm. The patient was considered to have achieved a partial response.\nOn July 28, 2019, pelvic MRI was repeated after the fourth cycle of neoadjuvant therapy. The imaging results showed that light thickening of anterior wall was persisting, but no node or obvious tumor was shown, and the result of urine cytology analysis was negative. Given these results, the patient strongly preferred bladder-sparing treatment.\nOn July 30, 2019, the patient received the second TURBt and randomized biopsies by cystoscopy. The pathological analysis showed inflammation and interstitial edema without any tumor in the bladder and the stage was downgraded to T0.\nConcurrent chemoradiotherapy started 1 month after the second TURBt. The regimen consisted of image-guided intensity-modulated conformal radiotherapy to the true pelvis with 45 Gy in 25 fractions plus the local lesion with 20 Gy in 10 fractions and concurrent cisplatin (40 mg/m2, once per week for 5 cycles). The side effects during chemoradiotherapy included second-degree fatigue and leukopenia. However, the patient recovered after symptomatic treatments. To evaluate the effect of chemoradiotherapy, the patient received pelvic MRI plus chest/abdominal CT on January 7 and cystoscopy on January 10, 2020. The results revealed that the bladder was normal with no sign of tumor recurrence. During this period, the patient received concurrent pembrolizumab (200 mg per 21 days). Finally, the patient achieved bladder preservation.\nIn addition, to monitor the status of the disease, urine tumor DNA sequencing analysis was carried out three times by a 642-gene panel from October 2019 to August 2020. The results showed that the mutation frequency of RB1 decreased significantly. On February 20, 2021, MRI results showed that there was still no tumor in the bladder. Cystoscopy and urine cytology analyses were also negative. The patient has maintained cancer-free status and excellent bladder function for 19 months at the end of follow-up.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does this patient have histologically documented muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC) from transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)?

He also reported dark-colored urine and intermittent episodes of hemoptysis during the same period. Specifically, he stated that his symptoms started four days after receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19. His first dose taken three weeks earlier was well tolerated. He denied any flank or abdominal pain, melena, fever, cough, hematuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and trauma. He denied smoking. Vital signs were stable upon admission. Physical examination was insignificant for any lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash. The patient was not on any medication prior to his hospitalization. Laboratory analysis was remarkable for serum creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL (0.8-1.4 mg/dL) along with hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours (<150 mg/24 hours). Our differential diagnosis at this point was wide including all nephritic syndromes given AKI, hematuria and proteinuria. All serological workup was subsequently sent. C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated 160 AU/mL (20-25 AU/mL) and anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies were also elevated >100 EU/ mL (normal <3.5 EU/mL) (Table ). Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not performed. All previous routine laboratory parameters including urinalysis were within normal range. He underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest for evaluation of hemoptysis that showed a right upper lobe consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusion. The renal ultrasound was unremarkable. Renal biopsy was subsequently performed and showed acute, pauci immune, focal necrotizing, and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figures , ). The patient was diagnosed with anti-PR3-associated ANCA glomerulonephritis. He received intense immunosuppression with plasma exchange x 5 cycles, intravenous prednisone 1 gram x 3 doses followed by prednisone 60 mg daily, cyclophosphamide x 2 doses, and rituximab x 4 doses.

Her past medical history was significant for multiple breast tumors. At age 19 years, a sarcoma of the left breast arising from a tubular adenoma was discovered. At that time, she underwent a segmental mastectomy. At age 20 years, she was diagnosed with a borderline PT of the same breast, treated with a nipple sparing mastectomy of the left breast. The patient\u2019s family history was significant for breast cancer in two maternal aunts. On physical examination of the right breast, a moveable mass at three o\u2019clock at a distance of 2 cm from the nipple was palpated. A targeted ultrasound of the right breast revealed a hypoechoic mass at the site of the clinically palpable mass with an abrupt interface, circumscribed margins, a combined pattern of posterior acoustics and an oval/lobulated shape, as seen in Figure .\n\nThe right axilla demonstrated no lymphadenopathy. Because of her significant past medical history, current presentation of an enlarging right breast mass and the sheer size of the tumor, primary breast malignancy was raised as a concern. Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the right breast was performed for a more accurate tissue diagnosis.\n\nHistology of the biopsy revealed sheets of basophilic spindle cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, atypical mitoses and frequent prominent nucleoli. Malignant stromal cells were seen infiltrating between benign-appearing glans. Due to the high suspicion for malignancy, a computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to assess for metastasis.\nThis scan indeed ruled out metastatic disease in this patient. The patient eventually had a simple mastectomy of the right breast. Histology of the mastectomy tissue demonstrated hypercellularity with malignant stromal cells and increased mitotic activity (30 mitoses per 10 high-power fields).\nBenign epithelium and periductal condensation of atypical stromal cells was also present.\nThe tissue showed multinucleated giant cells, which are commonly seen in malignant PTs. Additionally, a leaf-like architecture and hypercellular stroma that resembled fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were noted.\nImmunohistochemical stains were diffusely positive for cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) and vimentin and focally positive for caldesmon.\nThe tissue was negative for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 7, desmin, p63 and melan-A. The morphological findings and immunohistochemical staining profile were consistent with the diagnosis of primary malignant PTs of the right breast. Beyond this, metastasis from the previously diagnosed PT from the left breast was ruled out.\nThe patient received one round of adjuvant radiation to the breast and was monitored for recurrence. At two years of oncologic surveillance, the patient did not show any signs of active metastasis.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a mastectomy of the left breast?

The patient\u2019s family history was significant for breast cancer in two maternal aunts. On physical examination of the right breast, a moveable mass at three o\u2019clock at a distance of 2 cm from the nipple was palpated. A targeted ultrasound of the right breast revealed a hypoechoic mass at the site of the clinically palpable mass with an abrupt interface, circumscribed margins, a combined pattern of posterior acoustics and an oval/lobulated shape, as seen in Figure .\n\nThe right axilla demonstrated no lymphadenopathy. Because of her significant past medical history, current presentation of an enlarging right breast mass and the sheer size of the tumor, primary breast malignancy was raised as a concern. Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the right breast was performed for a more accurate tissue diagnosis.\n\nHistology of the biopsy revealed sheets of basophilic spindle cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, atypical mitoses and frequent prominent nucleoli. Malignant stromal cells were seen infiltrating between benign-appearing glans. Due to the high suspicion for malignancy, a computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was performed to assess for metastasis.\nThis scan indeed ruled out metastatic disease in this patient. The patient eventually had a simple mastectomy of the right breast. Histology of the mastectomy tissue demonstrated hypercellularity with malignant stromal cells and increased mitotic activity (30 mitoses per 10 high-power fields).\nBenign epithelium and periductal condensation of atypical stromal cells was also present.\nThe tissue showed multinucleated giant cells, which are commonly seen in malignant PTs. Additionally, a leaf-like architecture and hypercellular stroma that resembled fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were noted.\nImmunohistochemical stains were diffusely positive for cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) and vimentin and focally positive for caldesmon.\nThe tissue was negative for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 7, desmin, p63 and melan-A. The morphological findings and immunohistochemical staining profile were consistent with the diagnosis of primary malignant PTs of the right breast. Beyond this, metastasis from the previously diagnosed PT from the left breast was ruled out.\nThe patient received one round of adjuvant radiation to the breast and was monitored for recurrence. At two years of oncologic surveillance, the patient did not show any signs of active metastasis.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient had a mastectomy of the right breast?

He had features of septicemia such as drowsiness or Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11/15, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, pulse rate of 130 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/56 mmHg, and urine output of 15 mL/hour. He had no history of chronic disease, drug reaction, trauma, unknown bite, or significant familial disease. Blood investigations revealed low hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, raise leukocyte count of 28000/mm3, low albumin of 2.2 g/dL, raised serum creatinine of 2.23 mg/dL, serum urea of 174 mg/dL, and low sodium of 125 mEq/L. Serological markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (95 mm/hour) and procalcitonin (25.2 ng/mL) were higher. X-ray of the chest was grossly normal , and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck revealed irregular, well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing area in the right parotid gland with extension into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes. CECT of the chest revealed mild effusion in bilateral pleural space secondary to acute infection and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or osteomyelitis. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining from pleural fluid was negative for acid-fast bacillus (AFB bacilli). The patient was managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was diagnosed with acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes due to an unknown cause of septicemia. He underwent multiple aggressive debridements of the neck and chest wall. The cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) and ZN staining revealed positive mycobacteria and AFB bacilli for pathological tissue. Therefore, the pus collected in the parotid region and neck space was likely secondary to tubercular infection. A split-thickness graft was applied in multiple fractions after three weeks of anti-tubercular chemotherapy. The patient had a long hospital stay due to the difficult location and complexity of the ulcer over the neck.

She had a history of abdominal surgery for colon cancer (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma) in 2007. At presentation, her best-corrected decimal visual acuity was 0.6 oculus dexter (OD) and 0.9 oculus sinister (OS). Fundus examination revealed an orange-yellow mass that was 8 disc diameter (DD) in size with no measurable height at the inferotemporal side of the fundus OD, and a yellow-white mass 12 DD in size and 4.8 mm in height at the superior side of the fundus OS ( and ). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed hyperfluorescence inside the mass from early to late phase ( and ). Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 19-9, and cancer antigen 125 were within normal limits. A gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy scan showed no obvious abnormal uptake in the whole body including the eyes. Single-photon emission computed tomography with N-isopropyl-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine, which is known to be useful for the diagnosis of uveal melanoma, demonstrated no abnormal uptake in the eyes. In September 2011, the masses at the inferotemporal side OD and at the superior and inferior sides OS had enlarged, but visual acuity was preserved in both eyes. On both T1 and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the left orbit, iso-dense regions relative to the cerebral white matter were found consistent with the masses. A systemic workup to search for extraocular primary lesions revealed multiple nodules in the subcutaneous tissues of bilateral breasts on ultrasonography and neoplastic lesions in the right bronchial tubes on chest computed tomography. Histopathology of the tumor from a breast biopsy revealed foci of oval and spindle-shaped cells in alveolar and palisading arrangement (), and that from a lung biopsy showed oval hypertrophic nuclei and proliferation of atypical epithelial cells in rosette-like arrangement. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD56, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. These imaging and histological findings were consistent with breast and lung carcinoid tumors. From the clinical findings, general systemic workup, and clinical course, this case was presumptively diagnosed as choroidal metastasis from breast or lung carcinoid tumor. Fifteen months after the initial examination, the masses in both eyes expanded further. The mass at the inferotemporal side of the right eye was 20 DD in size and 3.5 mm in height. The mass at the superior side of left eye was 28 DD in size and 14.9 mm in height, and the mass at the inferior side was 7 DD in size and 5.5 mm in height. The left optic disc was invisible because of the enlarged mass, and best-corrected visual acuity was reduced to hand motion ( and ). An indocyanine green angiogram of the right eye showed choroidal vessel staining inside the mass from the early phase, and a mixture of hyper- and hypofluorescence in the late phase ( and ). External-beam radiotherapy of 40 Gy was used to treat the tumor in the left eye. Although the tumor in the right eye showed a tendency toward rapid expansion and required aggressive treatment to preserve vision, the tumor was still small and we had reservations about using external-beam radiotherapy due to the risk of adverse effects such as radiation retinopathy. Consequently, PDT was performed on her right eye after obtaining informed consent. Standard PDT was conducted with intravenous infusion of verteporfin at a dose of 6 mg/m2 body surface area over 10 minutes. Treatment parameters were 689 nm at 50 J (600 mW)/cm2 for an exposure time of 83 seconds. The diameter of each spot was 6,500 \u03bcm, and three spots with overlapping margin were administered. The tumor at the inferotemporal side was reduced to 7 DD and no measurable height after treatment. Later, a new mass 4 DD in size appeared at the inferonasal side and remained unchanged. The tumor at the superior side of the left eye was reduced after radiotherapy and the optic disc became visible ( and ). Best-corrected decimal visual acuity was 0.8 OD and 50 cm hand movement OS at 14 months after PDT (30 months after the initial visit) and the patient\u2019s general condition was stable.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) has this patient received external-beam radiotherapy?

An endoscopic study at the time revealed an ulcerative esophageal tumor 36\u201340 cm from the upper incisors, and biopsy results indicated squamous cell carcinoma. He also had severe funnel chest, and his sternum was almost attached to the vertebral bone. He previously noticed this chest deformity but had no symptoms such as chest pain; therefore, he had not undergone medical examination for this condition. The Haller index (i.e., the distance of the inner rib cage divided by the distance between the sternal notch and the vertebrae) was 9.9. According to the UICC-TNM classification (version 7), the final preoperative diagnosis was stage IIIA, squamous cell carcinoma (cT3, cN1, cM0). Although he had severe funnel chest, the preoperative examination revealed that his condition was generally good and he was fit to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. Two courses of 5-FU (800 mg/m2)/cisplatin (80 mg/m2) were administered as standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Then, we planned to perform funnel chest surgery (Nuss method) before esophagectomy, in order to achieve a suitable width in the mediastinum to allow for thoracoscopic surgery.\nFirst, two convex metal bars were inserted under the sternum through small bilateral thoracic incisions. The bars were inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly. When the bars were in position, they were turned over to reconstruct the sternum and widen the mediastinum so that esophagectomy could be performed. Radical thoracoscopic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection was performed with the patient in the left decubitus position, followed by gastric conduit reconstruction through the posterior mediastinum route. Surgery was performed without any complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Pathological staging according to the UICC-TNM classification (version 7) indicated stage IIIA (pT3, pN1, cM0). The metal bars were removed 1 year after surgery. The patient is in good condition today, the 2-year follow-up examination.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Was this patient ever diagnosed with esophageal  cancer?

A pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (Whipple) for definitive treatment was offered to the patient. The patient was reluctant to undergo major surgery and opted for systemic treatment instead. He presented to the ER two months after starting chemotherapy, on March 20, with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) (vomiting, belching, and weight loss). An attempt was made to manage the GOO non-operatively per the patient's wishes with duodenal stenting.\nA self-expanding, 22 mm x 9 cm fully covered, metal stent was placed into the second portion of the duodenum where a large, partially obstructing, ulcerated mass was visualized endoscopically.\nSeveral hours after the procedure, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed that the stent placement resulted in a perforation of the duodenum with extension into the retroperitoneum.\nEmergency pancreaticoduodenectomy versus damage control surgery were the two surgical options offered to the patient. The patient opted for damage control surgery. He was taken emergently for an exploratory laparotomy, washout of the abdomen, wide drainage, duodenostomy tube placement, and pyloric exclusion.\nHis postoperative course was uneventful, and he recovered quickly. After four months of healing, the patient underwent a definitive pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure. Final pathology revealed a mixed adeno-neuroendocrine carcinoma, arising from the duodenum/peri-ampullary area and invading into the pancreas and duodenal serosa (pT3, pN1, cM1) with 3 of 16 lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma and all margins negative.

Following a positive faecal occult blood test, a total colonoscopy was performed at a previous hospital in 2008 and a sigmoid colon lesion was identified. He was referred to our hospital for more precise examination and treatment. Colonoscopy revealed a 12 mm type 0-Is lesion in the sigmoid colon. We diagnosed the lesion as an adenoma or an intramucosal cancer and tried to remove this lesion by en bloc EMR. However, as a result the lesion was removed by piecemeal resection (2-pieces). The post-resection defect was closed using metallic endoclips.\r\nHistopathological examination revealed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma with low grade atypia, and the depth of invasion was intramucosa without lymphovascular invasion, cut end margin negative. We considered the treatment to be a curative resection. Follow up colonoscopy was performed 1 and 3 years after endoscopic resection. The EPMR scar was recognized without any residual or recurrent lesion in the follow up. Follow up colonoscopy was scheduled at 5 years after treatment, but cancelled for personal reasons.\r\nIn 2017, the third follow up colonoscopy revealed a protruding submucosal tumor (SMT), 20 mm in size at the site of the 2008 EPMR. The biopsy specimen from the colonic mucosa did not demonstrate any malignancy. Therefore, we planned a follow up colonoscopy 6 months later. The follow up colonoscopy revealed that the SMT-like lesion had grown to a large size, with a reddish surface pitted with crater-like irregularities. Histopathological diagnosis confirmed an adenocarcinoma, and a laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy with D3 lymph node resection was performed in 2017. Histopathological analysis of the resected lesion revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the depth of invasion was subserosa with lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, venous invasion and perineural invasion.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with prostate cancer?

Pt has new hx of renal failure and anemia. \nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Is there any evidence for hypersensitivity pneumonitis or another explanation for his pulmonary findings? CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Acute renal failure FINAL REPORT CLINICAL INDICATION: Bilateral upper lobe infiltrates at outside hospital with clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Additional history of renal failure. Helical and high-resolution CT imaging of the chest was performed without IV or oral contrast administration. Assessment of the lungs reveals multifocal areas of consolidation, some of which have a distinctly nodular configuration and others of which are more confluent. There is an upper lung zone predominance, particularly of the confluent areas of consolidation, which is also more prominent peripherally than centrally. In contrast, the multiple poorly defined nodular areas of opacification have both peribronchovascular and peripheral distributions. These nodular opacities vary in size but are less than 1.5 cm in diameter. A few of the nodules contain air bronchograms, and some of them have a halo of ground-glass opacification surrounding a central solid nodule. Scattered linear and reticular opacities are noted, but the dominant features are consolidation and nodular opacity. No honeycombing is identified. The central airways appear patent with no obstructing central endobronchial lesions observed. Soft tissue structures of the thorax demonstrate numerous small mediastinal lymph nodes measuring less than 1 cm in short axis dimension. The main pulmonary artery appears enlarged, measuring 4.4 cm in diameter. The heart size is normal. Coronary artery calcifications are present. No pericardial or significant pleural effusion is evident. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, several hepatic calcified granulomas are noted. The imaged portions of the spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is nonspecific mesenteric stranding in the upper abdomen and numerous small abdominal, mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted. The presence of soft tissue stranding is noted within the soft tissue structures of the chest and upper abdomen. Skeletal structures demonstrate degenerative changes within the spine. \nIMPRESSION: 2020-9-22 10:17 AM CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST\nReason: Is there any evidence for hypersensitivity pneumonitis or an Admitting Diagnosis: PNEUMONIA; RENAL FAILURE FINAL REPORT (Cont) 1. Bilateral upper lobe distribution of peripheral consolidation and diffuse, ill- defined small pulmonary nodules with both a peribronchovascular and peripheral distribution. The findings are nonspecific, but they favor chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or crytogenic organizing pneumonia. If there is a history of asthma and systemic symptoms , syndrome is an additional possibility. The differential diagnosis also includes atypical infection (fungal) and, less likely, a neoplastic process such as lymphoma. 2. Marked enlargement of main pulmonary artery, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. 3. Nonspecific findings within the upper abdomen, which is incompletely evaluated. This includes soft tissue stranding in the mesentery and multiple small lymph nodes. An active inflammatory or neoplastic process within the abdomen cannot be excluded. Dedicated contrast enhanced abdominal CT scan may be helpful for more complete assessment. 4. Stranding in the soft tissues of the chest and abdomen, likely due to anasarca.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever presented hypersensitivity reaction to triamcinolone acetonide?

A tru-cut biopsy was obtained from malignant necrotic ecchymosis under antibiotic prophylaxis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic and MRI of the lower extremity were performed. The results showed a mass obliterating the endometrium and a pathologic lymphadenopathy, measuring 30 \u00d7 15 mm, on the left inguinal region. Vaginal ultrasound was performed and adnexal atrophy and cysts in uterus were detected. Dilatation and curettage was performed on endometrium and patient was diagnosed with high-grade cancer. MRI of the lower extremity showed a heterogeneous mass, which is measuring 56 \u00d7 40 mm and is infiltrating proximal parts of third and fourth metatarsal bones and muscle and fat tissue on dorsal part of left foot. Positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed for stating. The results demonstrated a lesion, measuring 10.5 \u00d7 6.5 \u00d7 5.5 cm, extending from skin to extensor muscles and infiltrating proximal fourth and fifth phalanges in intermetatarsal spaces on plantar surface of the foot (SUVmax: 13.6). A primary lesion, measuring 25 mm in diameter, that is extending from medial calcaneus to subcutaneous tissue on proximal and one-third part of the middle part of left lower extremity (SUVmax: 26.5) and a second primary mass, measuring 45 \u00d7 28 mm, that is filling corpus of the uterus (SUVmax: 45.8) are noted. A metastatic lymph node, measuring 2 cm in diameter, is noted (SUVmax: 9.1). The results of the biopsy were evaluated and patient was diagnosed with high-grade DLBCL. The both tumors histopathological features were similar. This was in accordance with germinal centered high-grade non-Burkitt DLBCL. DLBCL-leg was diagnosed when MUM1 (+), CD20 (+), CD3 (\u2212), CD5 (\u2212), CD38 focal (+), CD79a (+), c-myc 20 to 30% (+), bcl-2 (+), bcl-6 (+), and CD10 (\u2212) were evaluated with clinical findings. The uterine tumor was diagnosed as stage IEA DLBCL according to the Lugano modification of Ann Arbor classification, the other tumor was diagnosed as T2aN1M0 according to WHO-EORTC classification and R-CHOP chemotherapy was initiated. After three courses of R-CHOP, PET-CT was performed. The scan showed almost complete regression in mass in uterus; complete regression in lesion on dorsum of the left foot and partial regression in anterior lesion of left lower extremity. After six courses of chemotherapy, PET-CT was performed and it demonstrated a residual mass extending to subcutaneous tissue and muscles of dorsum of left foot (SUVmax: 2.0) ( ). A skin biopsy was performed. The results showed no cutaneous lymphoma, but atrophy of the dermis was detected. No residual mass was noted histopathologically; therefore, salvage RT was not planned.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Was the patient diagnosed with cancer in a lower extremity?

After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair. However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes. The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of \u221245 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient participated in a clinical trial with an investigational product, on a date relative to the date of the clinical note?

Her nationality and race were Korean and Mongoloid, respectively. She visited the outpatient clinic for pain in her knee and hip joints on both sides. The knee pain had developed seven years ago and was more severe on the right than on the left and caused a lot of disruption in her daily life. The patient also had been experiencing knee instability since adolescence, but no special diagnosis or management had been performed. The instability was aggravated by sitting, standing up or pivoting motions. The patient complained of a 3-year history of pain in the hip joints of both sides without any special trauma, which made it difficult to walk more than 500 m without walking aids. The patient had no past or family history of diseases that would be accompanied by multiple joint pain. Upon physical examination, the right knee presented with slight joint effusion and no marked anterior or posterior laxity (negative Lachman and pivot shift tests and anterior/posterior drawer tests), but the patient had an instability on the frontal plane (laxity at the valgus: grade 3, laxity at the valgus; grade 3). The left knee also showed no marked anterior or posterior laxity (negative Lachman and pivot shift tests and anterior/posterior drawer tests), but instability on the frontal plane (laxity at the valgus: grade 3, laxity at the valgus; grade 3) was demonstrated. There was no limitation in the range of motion of either knee. Both hip joints were positive on the Patrick test and rolling test and both joints showed a limited range of motion (right: flexion 90\u00b0, extension 10\u00b0, abduction 25\u00b0, adduction 15\u00b0, internal rotation 10\u00b0, external rotation 20\u00b0; left: flexion 95\u00b0, extension 10\u00b0, abduction 20\u00b0, adduction 15\u00b0, internal rotation 15\u00b0, external rotation 20\u00b0). Blood tests showed that the whole blood cell test, as well as the liver, kidney, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal function tests, were all within normal limits. Tests related to autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, and HLA B27) were all negative. A lower extremity scannogram showed more valgus anatomic axes (right: 12\u00b0, left: 10\u00b0) than normal (reference value: 6\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0) (A). Both knee standing radiographs showed joint space narrowing of the lateral compartment with osteoarthritis (right: Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3, left: Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4) and hypoplasia of the tibial intercondylar eminence and flat trochlea femoralis were also seen (B). Physician-applied varus/valgus stress radiographs revealed lateral and medial compartment joint openings in both knees (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed reduction of the cartilage thickness in the weight-bearing area of the lateral femoral condyle, a scarcely pronounced intercondylar notch and absence of the ACL (). On both hip anteroposterior views, both hip joints showed severe osteoarthritis (right: K\u2013L grade 4, left: K\u2013L grade 4) (). On the basis of the above clinical and image findings, we diagnosed congenital aplasia of the ACL with secondary knee and hip osteoarthritis. The patient complained of more pain in the right knee and right hip than in the left side, so right total knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA, THA) were performed simultaneously. About one year after the last surgery, the patient presented with more aggravated pain and instability of the left knee and hip joint. She underwent TKR and THR simultaneously (). As a result of the surgeries, the patient's symptoms improved and she was satisfied with the results. After the surgeries and follow-up for more than a year (right 24 months, left 12 months), both her knee and hip were pain-free without evidence of instability on physical examination\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does the patient have a knee osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 4?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"left: Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4\".

Glycogen storage disease type Ia was diagnosed during infancy (fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly), and confirmed by molecular diagnosis (compound heterozygosity for both c.527A>G and c.1039 C>T mutations in the glucose 6 phosphatase gene). This patient also has both Willebrand and Gilbert diseases. He had been treated with growth hormone at 12 years of age, for 1 year, for retarded growth, with no clinical improvement. He had been an active smoker since the age of 15 years, and recently quit smoking. He used to have chronic metabolic imbalance during the second decade of life. Supplementations with uncooked cornstarch since infancy, then enteral nutrition by the age of 17 were not well tolerated because of chronic diarrhea. Blood tests performed at 22 were disturbed as follow: triglyceridemia 19 mmoL/L, uricemia 0.498 mmoL/L, bicarbonate 16 mmoL/L, lactic acid before breakfast 9 mmoL/L. The patient slowly developed hepatic polyadenomatosis. He also developed osteoporosis. When he was 22 years old, uncooked cornstarch (300-420 g/day) was replaced by Glycosade and oral fenofibrate was started. His diet was hyperglucidic, glucides representing 63% of caloric intake. This treatment allowed an improvement of metabolic balance. His metabolic blood tests between 22 and 25 years of age were as follow: triglyceridemia between 2.28 and 4.56 mmoL/L, uricemia between 0.4 and 0.5 mmoL/L, lactic acid before breakfast between 3 and 5 mmoL/L, bicarbonate between 20 and 24 mmoL/L. Hepatic polyadenomatosis remained stable on regular MRI follow-up since the age of 22. He had no renal disease. Proteinuria and microalbuminuria were negative, creatinine clearance was 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cockroft-Gault), calciuria was low. It is noteworthy that renal cysts had never been observed, either on MRI or on ultrasound examination. He was referred to our center this month, as a 25 year-old, for his annual follow-up. His metabolic balance is good and the blood tests he had last week were as follow: creatinine clearance 123 mL/min (Cockroft-Gault), proteinuria <0.02 g/L, microalbuminuria 13.6 mg/L, uric acid 0.438 mmoL/L, triglyceridemia 2.52 mmoL/L, cholesterol 5.07 mmoL/L, hemoglobin 141 g/L, C reactive protein <5 mg/L, aspartate amino transferase 0.54 \u03bcKat/l (32 UI/l), alanine amino transferase 0.38 \u03bcKat/l (23 UI/l), GGT 0.69 \u03bcKat/l (41 UI/l). Glycemias were normal during 24 hours before and after meals, lactic acid were measured between 1.7 and 3.1 mmoL/L during 24 hours. Hepatic MRI showed multiple adenomas and decrease in size of the largest adenoma (41 mm vs 48 mm the year before). Renal MRI showed the appearance of a nodular lesion, at the lower pole of left kidney. The lesion diameter was 28 mm. On T1 weighted images, the lesion was isointense. On T2 weighted images, it was discretely hyperintense, with discrete contrast enhancement after injection (Figure ). The patient underwent partial nephrectomy. The diagnosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 (grad ISUP2) was confirmed by histological study (Figure ). Nephroprotective treatment was started with ACE inhibitor (ramipril 2.5 mg/day). No relapse had occurred at the last follow-up visit. His blood test 2 years after nephrectomy were as follow: creatinine clearance 148 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cockroft-Gault), no urinary albumin excretion, uricemia 0.290 mmoL/L, triglyceridemia 1.55 mmoL/L, lactatemia and glycemia normal before and after meals. Due to the rarity of this tumor and the young age of the patient, a genetic cause has been evoked but not confirmed to date (looking for a germline mutation of the fumarate hydratase gene).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What is the most recent creatinine clearance of this patient according to the Cockroft-Gault equation?

She had no history of cancer and reported a 29-pack-year smoking history. Physical examination demonstrated no palpable lymph nodes or abdominal masses. Her baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 54 mL/minute/1.73 m2. A CT urogram delineated a 1.5 cm right renal pelvic lesion with no evidence of local advancement or LAD in the abdomen or pelvis.\nCystoscopy showed no bladder lesions and the left retrograde pyelogram was unremarkable. Right ureteroscopy demonstrated a 1.5 cm papillary lesion, which was biopsied with a 2.4F stainless steel flat wire basket. The lesion was treated with the combination neodymium/holmium YAG laser. A ureteral stent was placed for 1 week.\nThe ureteroscopic biopsy and site-specific cytologies demonstrated low-grade UTUC. All options were discussed with the patient and ureteroscopic treatment and surveillance were recommended given the patient's age, comorbidities, low-grade pathology analysis, and relatively small tumor size. The patient was followed endoscopically for the next 36 months, occasionally finding low-volume, low-grade recurrences, amenable to endoscopic treatment. No evidence of high-grade UTUC was noted during this time on biopsies or site-specific cytologies. The patient developed small high-grade, noninvasive bladder tumors 12 months after initial presentation, mandating intravesical therapy with BCG, which was well tolerated and effective.\nThe patient had cross-sectional imaging yearly with contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis without findings of local advancement or metastatic disease. At 42 months from initial presentation, the patient developed significant pain in her right upper leg and complained of a 10-pound weight loss. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated new onset of right-sided pelvic LAD with a 3.3 cm right external iliac node, 1.6 cm right common iliac node, and 3.2 cm right obturator node. The chest, retroperitoneum, and liver were clear. The kidneys demonstrated no evidence of locally advanced disease. A bone scan demonstrated increased uptake in the right femur consistent with malignancy.\nFormal lymph node biopsy was deferred by the patient, but a fine needle aspiration of the right external iliac lymph node with flow cytometry demonstrated findings consistent with a B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasm. The patient's right leg pain spontaneously improved. The presumed diagnosis was an insidious B-cell lymphoma and active surveillance was instituted.\nSix months later, a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan demonstrated resolution of LAD save for a right axillary node. After formal biopsy, this demonstrated a grade 3A FL. Multiple osseous lesions were now noted but the patient was asymptomatic. Endoscopic surveillance of the right renal unit demonstrated low volumes of recurrent UTUC, which had advanced to high grade.

He had no pre-existing diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and no known intracranial or intracardiac metastases. He was enrolled in the TRITON-2 trial (NCT02952534; PR CO-338-052), receiving oral rucaparib 600 mg twice daily for 9 months prior to the index admission. His only other regular medication was paracetamol. Baseline and serial electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was not undertaken during the trial period and pre-existing prolonged QT on an earlier ECG from 2013 (QTc 465 ms) did not preclude him from enrolment in this trial. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved on transthoracic echocardiogram prior to enrolment. Following rucaparib initiation, he had no cardiac symptoms or hospital presentations until the index admission. He presented with a collapse at home without a clear cause and no acute injuries. In the emergency department, he remained in sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ward on cardiac monitoring. Shortly after arriving on the ward, he developed TdP () with altered conscious status requiring brief cardiopulmonary resuscitation (30 s) followed by a single direct cardioversion shock (200 J biphasic) and 20 mmol/L intravenous magnesium sulphate. Post-arrest, he appeared pale and cachectic with no jaundice, murmurs, or signs of fluid overload. He had a Glascow Coma Scale of 15, with no signs of asterixis. ECG showed a broad junctional rhythm at a rate of 52 b.p.m. (left bundle branch block pattern) with marked U waves in V2\u2013V4 and severe QT prolongation (QTc 680 ms) (). Rucaparib was discontinued immediately. An ECG performed 5 years prior to rucaparib initiation demonstrated first degree atrioventricular block and a long QT interval (QTc 465 ms) (). There was no personal history of coronary artery disease or syncope and no family history of cardiogenic syncope or sudden cardiac death. Notably, an ECG performed 3 months following rucaparib initiation showed marked QT prolongation (QTc interval 589 ms, ), in the absence of syncope. Rucaparib continued as QT interval, both pre- and post-enrolment, are not routinely monitored as part of the TRITON-2 trial and the marked increase in QT interval was not documented during the trial follow-up. The patient did not undergo ECG or Holter monitoring following rucaparib initiation. No other QT prolonging agents were prescribed. The only other regular medication was paracetamol 1 g up to four times per day for pain management in the setting of bony metastases. There was no electrolyte abnormality detected [serum potassium 4.4 mmol/L (normal range 3.5\u20135.0 mmol/L) and serum magnesium 1.0 mmol/L (normal range 0.7\u20131.1 mmol/L)] and both renal and hepatic function were satisfactory. Isoprenaline infusion (2 \u03bcg/min) was introduced due to recurrent rate-related TdP in the context of bradycardia. On day 3 of admission, isoprenaline was ceased and the QT interval was notably shorter (QTc interval 547 ms; ) with an intrinsic heart rate of 93 b.p.m. in atrial flutter. Consideration was given to permanent pacing given an initial projected life expectancy of >12 months, however, despite rhythm stabilization, he deteriorated precipitously while in hospital, likely as a consequence of oncological disease progression with refractory symptoms in addition to the physiological insult of resuscitation in an elderly, already frail, cachectic gentleman with limited reserve. The patient was palliated, and the family subsequently declined post-mortem genetic testing or familial screening for inheritable long QT syndrome (LQTS).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) does this patient have castration resistant prostate cancer?

Shave biopsy revealed a nodular and focally infiltrative BCC. He was referred to the Mohs Surgery clinic for treatment. The patient had a past medical history of multiple aggressive scalp BCCs. Five years prior he underwent Mohs surgery for two BCCs on the left and right parietal scalp. The left parietal scalp BCC recurred 18 months later and he was treated at an outside plastic surgery clinic with a wide local excision. He developed a BCC on the vertex scalp 9 months after that which was treated with Mohs surgery. Due to extension to bone, the patient also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy. Mohs surgery was initiated for the most recent recurrent BCC on the vertex of the scalp (). Frozen section analysis revealed diffuse infiltrative BCC in the dermis and subcutaneous fat. In the fifth stage, intravascular tumor cells were noted (), and the patient was still positive in five out of six specimens with a defect measuring 6.5 \u00d7 7.0 cm2 (). Intravascular invasion, with CD31(+) and CD34(+) vascular channels, was confirmed with permanent sections by a board-certified dermatopathologist. No evidence of perineural involvement was seen in the sections examined. Mohs surgery was stopped given the concern for widespread disease of the scalp and inability to attain a clear margin. A positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan was ordered to evaluate for metastatic disease. The PET/CT scan demonstrated diffuse heterogeneous moderate tracer distribution in the left scalp wound favoring malignant involvement with an overlap of activity into the left parietal bone with erosion of the cortex, favoring osseous involvement. Prominent activity was last noted in the left cervical level IIa nodes, right sacrum, right scapula, and the third left rib, concerning for metastatic disease. A right sacral ala biopsy showed infiltrating nests of basaloid tumor cells in a sclerotic stroma, consistent with metastatic BCC (). After discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board involving head and neck surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology, he started vismodegib 150 mg daily. Repeat PET/CT scan 6 months later showed decrease in the activity of right sacrum metastatic lesions, consistent with response to treatment, and stable cervical IIa nodes. However, there was an interval new subcutaneous focus over the right cheek suggestive of new BCC development, which is being managed with vismodegib at this time.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does this patient have at least two BCC tumors?

He was found to have brain metastasis when he presented with intra-cranial bleeding, which necessitated an excision of the solitary brain metastasis. He presented with hematuria 1 year after the initial diagnosis of his lung cancer. Initial investigations with plain radiographs and mid-stream urine sampling were unrevealing. His urine cytology demonstrated suspicious cells with marked variation of nuclear size, irregularity of nuclear outline, and abnormal chromatin pattern []. He underwent a computed tomographic urography, which revealed a 2.7 cm contrast-enhancing posterior bladder wall mass with transmural involvement. The urogram phase revealed its fungative morphology []. Our patient underwent a flexible cystoscopy, which revealed a 3 cm sessile vascular growth with rugged edges and a central crater at the left lateral wall. The surrounding mucosa appeared distorted and elevated, which was suggestive of a growth beneath the intact bladder mucosa []. Biopsy of the tumor mass revealed adenocarcinoma, favored lung primary. A transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed to alleviate his hematuria. shows the histological appearance of the brain metastasis. The tumor demonstrated true papillae with fibrovascular cores, features which were diagnostic of adenocarcinoma. The tumor was also diffusely and strongly positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) (mouse monoclonal, 1:100, Dako Denmark), a marker which was positive in majority of primary lung adenocarcinoma.[] shows the histological appearance of the bladder tumor. The tumor was morphologically reminiscent of the brain metastasis. The overlying transitional cell epithelium was intact and benign, whereas the underlying detrusor muscle was extensively infiltrated by the tumor. A directed panel of immunohistochemistry () revealed the tumor cells showed a cytokeratin 7 (CK7) (mouse anti-human, 1:300, Dako Denmark) positive, CK20 (mouse anti-human, 1:100, Dako Denmark) negative and TTF1 positive phenotype, which was most compatible with adenocarcinoma of lung primary.[] It was of note that the residual transitional epithelium retained its CK20 positive property. Our patient had external-beam radiotherapy for his scalp metastasis on June 3, 2020 but decided not for further systemic therapy for his lung cancer. There was no recurrence of gross hematuria as reported by the patient up to the time when this article was prepared (3 months post-transurethral resection).

However, his serum prostate specific antigen level increased to 899 ng/mL, so he was diagnosed as docetaxel resistant CRPC. Figure shows bone metastases. The patient was treated for bone metastases with 37.5 Gy/15 fr to the thoracic spine (Th 7) as a local radiotherapy from February 2019 to March 2019. The radiation induced only mild dermatitis as an adverse event. Moreover, internal fixation of the left femur was performed to prevent pathological fractures due to metastasis to the left femur on August 2016. He also received six cycles of intravenous injections of radium-223 (50 kBq/kg) once every 4 weeks from September 2019 to January 2020.\r\nOn admission in April 20th 2020, the patient was started on cabazitaxel at 22.5 mg/m2 with proactive management of adverse events, including the use of a prophylactic long-acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and an oral empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent (sitafloxacin hydrate, a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone that is very active against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) to prevent febrile neutropenia. On day 10, grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were observed. He was treated with an intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent (cefepime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with enhanced coverage against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria), which resulted in cessation of the fever and increased neutrophil count, although sputum and blood cultures revealed negative. On day 18, he developed a secondary fever of 38 \u00b0C again despite neutrophil count of 3000/\u03bcL, so antimicrobial administration (cefepime) was restarted due to a suspected infection. Three days later, he complained of dyspnea and had a pulse oximetric saturation (SpO2) of 80% while breathing room air. The serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein (SP-D) levels were 744 U/mL and 147 ng/mL (normal ranges, < 500 U/ml and < 100 ng/ml, respectively). The serum levels of procalcitonin, endotoxin concentration and (1,3)-beta-D-glucan were not elevated. Chest X-ray showed interstitial opacities indicative of inflammation in the irradiated field of the both lungs. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed interstitial lung disease with ground glass opacities in the irradiated field of both lungs. These characteristic image findings could have been associated with drug toxicity, due to the treatment of thoracic radiation therapy followed by cabazitaxel.\r\nOn 15/05/2020 the intravenous steroid pulse therapy was started at a methylprednisolone of 1000 mg a day for 3 days, followed by prednisolone at 1.0 mg/kg of body mass per day for a week. The patient improved and dyspnea disappeared. SpO2 showed 95% while breathing room air. The ground-glass opacities had also improved. The dosage of prednisolone was gradually reduced every week.

On examination, a generalized probing depth of 6\u20137 mm with the moderate horizontal bone loss was observed. The oral hygiene of the patient was fair with a moderate amount of supragingival and subgingival deposits. The patient was systemically healthy with no history of any cutaneous skin lesions, drug intake, or allergic reaction to any medication or irritant. A nonsurgical phase one therapy comprising of full mouth oral prophylaxis and root surface debridement was initiated. Ibuprofen 200 mg was prescribed post-treatment in case any pain or discomfort was experienced. The patient was recalled after 2 weeks for re-evaluation and follow-up. However, the patient reported back within 1 h, with the development of a sudden, localized, soft, edematous, non-fluctuant, and nonmovable lobular swelling on the frontal and temporal part of his forehead. The swelling was tender on palpation with slight erythema on its outer surface []. The patient also reported the development of a mild rise in body temperature, lassitude, and malaise. Based on the patient's history and the timing of onset of allergic response, ibuprofen-induced hypersensitivity reaction was suspected. The patient was questioned regarding the onset of any similar incidents in the past. The patient then reported the onset of a similar swelling a few years back (etiology unknown). The patient was immediately referred to a physician, and blood was withdrawn to check for the total and differential blood count delete was done. The blood reports showed increases in the eosinophils (absolute eosinophils count = 9.67 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL (H); differential cell count = 16.5%) suggestive of an allergic reaction []. A local prick skin test with ibuprofen was also performed to confirm the hypersensitivity reaction []. To exclude the cross-reactivity and tolerance to other chemically unrelated NSAIDS, an oral challenge with other COX 1 inhibitors (aspirin) was done. The patient was immediately administered 10\u201320 mg intravenous injection of pheniramine maleate to control the reaction. A drastic reduction in the temporal swelling was observed within 24 h.

After Mohs surgery, wound healing was unremarkable. However, a combined brow and upper lid ptosis had developed and hampered his lateral view []. On the other hand, he needed his car and so rehabilitative surgery was planned. Since he had a blepharochalasis, we used a combined approach, i.e. blepharoplasty of the upper lid and direct brow lift. The procedures were performed under local anaesthesia. Because there was no prolapse of the adipose tissue, a simple skin resection of the upper lid skin was performed and sutured with 4-0 Prolene (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany) sutures. For the brow lift, an elliptical incision on the apical border of the brow was performed []. The height of the incision was measured before by pulling the brow to its intended height and marking the position. After the removal of skin, the deeper layers were carefully removed down to the insertion of the insertions of muscle fibres of the venter frontalis. The vessels including the arteria conjunctivalis posterior were carefully preserved. We deepened the lateral part to the areolar tissue superficial to the periosteum. The skin adjacent to the incision borders was loosened by blunt preparation to ensure a tension-free suturing. The frontalis muscle was resected and the ends were sutured by 4-0 PDS (Ethicon) sutures to position the brow [Figure , ]. Wound closure was done by suturing the subcutaneous tissue with deep knots (4-0 PDS) and final wound closure with cutaneous 4-0 Ethilon (Ethicon) sutures []. After the removal of the suture, we recommended a preventive topical scar treatment (Cicaplast\u00ae; La Roche Posay, Asnieres, France). There was no significant scarring or other late adverse effects. The patient was very pleased with the outcome.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does this patient have at least two BCC tumors?

She denied any nausea, vomiting, headache, or gait disturbances.\nThe patient's family history was unknown as she was adopted. The patient's medical history was significant for bipolar disorder. On physical exam, patient was alert and oriented and cranial nerves were found to be intact. Palpable, nontender masses in the anterior neck were appreciated on head and neck examination. A mobile, nontender, 1 cm lump was also present on the left breast.\nCT, MRI, and fine needle aspiration of the thyroid masses performed last month revealed bilateral nonmalignant nodules measuring 1.9 cm and 1.7 cm on the right side and 2.2 cm and 2.3 cm on the left. The nodules abutted the esophagus bilaterally.\nMRI of the head revealed mild hydrocephalus and a right 3.8 cm cerebellar mass with a \"tiger-stripe\" appearance consistent with LDD. Total resection of the lesion was performed and histopathologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis.\nMammogram, MRI, and core biopsy of the breasts were also performed in late April, which showed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent bilateral mastectomy. Histology revealed a 0.8 cm invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast (T1bN0), estrogen positive, progesterone positive, and HER2 negative, and a 1.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast (T1cN0), estrogen positive, progesterone positive, and HER2 negative. Her Oncotype DX breast cancer recurrence score was 24 for her left breast carcinoma, corresponding with a 15% risk of distant recurrence over 10 years. She was given 4 doses of Taxotere and Cytoxan. The patient declined tamoxifen therapy.\nGenetic testing results confirmed the presence of the R335X (c.1003C>T) mutation in the PTEN gene and the patient was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome.

Additional complaints include fatigue, weight loss, and nail dystrophy. She had not had any of these symptoms in her medical history before. She started to complain of dry mouth and nail dystrophy 4 months before admission. During that period she lost 4 kg and felt severe fatigue. Two months before admission, she underwent a health screening in another hospital and received a diagnosis of renal dysfunction and hypothyroidism. There was no fever, rash, Raynaud phenomenon, or articular complaints. She had no medical history, and denied tobacco or alcohol abuse. There was no history of renal disease in her family. Her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 62/minute, and her body temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C. Her conjunctiva was pale and her oral cavity was dry. Her nails were flattened and revealed onycholysis. A KOH test showed no fungi in her nails. Her thyroid gland was not enlarged and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. No abnormality was present in the urological findings and neurologic examinations. Laboratory findings disclosed the following: hemoglobin 69 g/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 53 mm/hour, serum protein 88 g/L, albumin 26 g/L, serum creatinine 298.8 umol/L, and creatinine clearance 15 ml/minute according to Cockcroft and Gault formula. Urine sediment contained 0\u20132 white blood cells (WBC) and 0\u20132 red blood cells (RBC) per field. Her 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 0.696 g/day. Antinuclear antibodies, antibodies to SSA and SSB, rheumatoid factor, complement fractions, and cryoglobulins were all negative or within the normal range. In a urine protein electrophoresis, the proportion of urine protein was the following: albumin 87.6%, \u03b11-globulin 4.0%, \u03b12-globulin 1.1%, \u00df-globulin 0%, and \u03b3-globulin 7.3%. Serum and urine protein immunofixation electrophoresis showed no abnormal finding. Serum free light chain of kappa and lambda was increased (0.307 g/L and 0.192 g/L, respectively). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was raised at 38.55 g/L (normal 7.0\u201317.0), however, IgA and IgM levels were normal (3.04 g/L and 2.45 g/L, respectively). A slit lamp examination revealed superficial keratoconjunctival erosion in both eyes. A 99mTc pertechnetate scan of her salivary gland showed normal function. A lip biopsy demonstrated amyloid deposition around her salivary ducts, and atrophy of her salivary duct. There was no mononuclear infiltration. A renal ultrasound scan showed increased echogenicity and the size of her right kidney and left kidney was 10.32 cm and 9.42 cm, respectively. A renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy revealed a glomerular and peripheral capillary wall deposition of eosinophilic amorphous hyaline material. The Congo red stain by birefringence under polarized light showed apple-green staining reaction. Under electron microscopy, we observed non-branching, randomly distributed 10 nm-wide fibrils.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What is the creatinine clearance of this patient according to the Cockroft-Gault equation?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"creatinine clearance 15 ml/minute according to Cockcroft and Gault formula\".

Otherwise healthy, she had initially consulted her general practitioner simply for abdominal distension. Further investigations [abdominal computed tomography (CT), serum CA125determination and laparoscopy] revealed a peritoneal carcinomatosis. The diagnosis of stage III (FIGO classification) ovarian cancer was established and the patient received a carboplatin-paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimen in a neoadjuvant setting. The indication of a debulking surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) was retained by our institutional tumor board. A CVL was inserted via the right jugular vein into the superior vena cava in prevision of surgery and the appropriate positioning of the catheter was verified by chest x-ray. An implantable central venous catheter (Port-a-Cath) was already in place. The first 48 postoperative hours were marked by difficult pain management, hypotension, and transient hyperlactatemia responding to fluid replacement and norepinephrine. On postoperative day 3, she presented acute onset dyspnea when transferred from the bed to a chair, and a major drop in pulse oxygen saturation (from SpO2 96% to 83%) justified the administration of oxygen (5 L/min) via a nasal cannula. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.4 \u00b0C, blood pressure 135/81 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min. No chest pain was reported. Pulmonary examination revealed a bilateral reduction of basal breath sounds with dullness at percussion. Chest x-ray examination showed bilateral pleural effusions that could largely explain patient\u2019s dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. After switching from a nasal cannula to a nonrebreather mask (FiO2 0.40), the patient\u2019s condition seemed to stabilize in supine position. A measurement of the arteriovenous oxygen difference was obtained via sampling through the arterial and central venous line after the patient was again lying in supine position . A sampling error or a wrong positioning of the recent CVL was suspected, but a sample taken from the Port-a-Cath confirmed the venous value. A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bubble test failed to show a right-to-left shunt, atrial septum was intact. No pulmonary hypertension was detected and right ventricle was not dilated. A CT pulmonary angiography (Fig. ) showed large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of both lower lobes, acute pulmonary embolism in the right middle and upper lobe pulmonary arteries, and ultimately an anatomical variant of the left upper pulmonary vein draining into the left innominate vein. Following bilateral chest drainage, the patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin twice daily. There was no evidence for deep venous thrombosis. This was followed by a significant clinical improvement, a disappearance of the platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia complaints and a reduction of oxygen requirement over the following days. At 1-year follow-up, TTE showed no right ventricular dilation and absence of pulmonary hypertension. From an oncological perspective, stability was also observed during her niraparib maintenance therapy, with absence of new lesions at a 1-year follow-up abdominal CT.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever received a PARP inhibitor?

The patient was then subjected to an ultrasound examination, which confirmed the presence of a lump with malignant characteristics, and was therefore subjected to true-cut of the breast lump with histological examination positive for invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.\nIn late March 2020, the patient underwent a quadrantectomy of the right breast with removal of 2 cm neoplastic nodule and three ipsilateral sentinel lymph nodes. The microscopic examination was positive for moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma containing osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs). According to immunohistochemical analysis, the tumor had the following characteristics: ER: + 100%, PR: + 85%, E-cadherin: positive, Ki67: + 10% and HER2: negative, with a staging category corresponding to pT1c pN0, according to the TNM staging system.\nImmunohistochemically, OGCs are positive for the histiocytic marker CD68 and negative for E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, and for ER, PR and HER2. In addition, they are CD163 positive.\nOn the other hand, cancer cells are negative for CD68 and CD163 for the HER2 but are positive for cadherin E, estrogen receptor (ER: 100%) and progesterone receptor (PR: 85%).\nClinical\u2013instrumental staging tests (blood chemistry tests with tumor markers, abdomen ultrasound, chest CT without bone and bone scan) were negative for distant neoplastic disease.\nFor the negative HER2 hormone-responsive disease, various analysis tests of gene profiles are available and are useful in determining the risk of relapse of disease in early breast cancer, in order to assess the need for chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy.\nIn this clinical case, the Oncotype Dx test provided was used in our institute on March 30, with a recurrence score of 23. Considering the age of the patient, \u226450 years, the use of chemotherapy was found to correspond to a benefit of approximately 6.5%.\nAfter a multidisciplinary collegial discussion, and considering the age, the absence of comorbidity, the premenopausal state, the rare histotype and the Oncotype Dx report, the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, according to the Docetaxel-Cyclophosphamide q21 scheme, for 4 cycles, followed by hormone therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue and exemestane.\nThe patient, aware of the benefits and risks related to the aforementioned therapeutic proposal, decided to accept it.

Prostate volume was calculated at 202 g at TRUS. No lymph node of pathologic size was determined at multiparametric prostate MRI. During RALRP, a 2/0 Vicryl suture was applied on the median lobe for traction to supply a better view for bladder neck and exposure of the large median lobe. We subsequently observed an injury of the left ureter orifice occurred during dissection with monopolar scissors. At inspection, the right ureter orifice was natural in appearance, whereas the left orifice had lost its natural appearance in association with a laceration. However, peristalsis and urinary flow from the area thought to be the left ureter orifice were observed. Online video call was made with experienced colleagues who were in another city (A.F.A. and A.E.C.) and the surgical fields on the screen were presented to them to get advice. Owing to their suggestion, two 4.7F 28 cm Double-J stents were inserted through the assistant port into the abdomen and installed in the both ureteral orifices, and RALRP was completed. The second orifice was also stented to prevent injury. Postoperative prostate weight was measured as 202 g. Estimated blood loss was 250 mL. During control ultrasonography (USG) performed on postoperative day 1, the bilateral kidneys were normal, and no hydronephrosis was observed. Postoperative follow-up was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 7. Cystography was performed on day 21 that showed no leakage and urethral catheter was removed. Control USG was performed periodically during hospitalization and no hydronephrosis was observed. The pathology report was pT2a with negative surgical margins. The Double-J stents were removed with the assistance of a flexible endoscope on the second month. The ureter orifices remained behind the neck of the bladder with normal appearance.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does the patient have prostatic adenocarcinoma?

He was admitted in the emergency department for cephalalgia, fever, and frequent easy vomiting lasting 1 week duration. Symptoms were associated to a puffiness of the face and dyspnea of level I according to Sadoul classification. At admission, the patient was conscious with a fever of 39\u00b0C. The blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg with a heart rate of 80 beats/min and a respiratory frequency of 24 cycles/min. The neurological examination objectified signs of meningeal irritation without any motor and sensory deficit. The pleuropulmonary examination found subcutaneous emphysema in the top part of the thorax and upper limbs extending to the cervical region and the face. Associated air effusion syndrome was not evidenced. The initial cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan was normal. Afterward, a lumbar puncture was performed and revealed a blurred liquid with predominant polynuclear neutrophils (80%). The glycorrhachia was 0.40 g/l (with concomitant glycemia of 1.20 g/l); total albumin level was 0.98 g/l, and the classical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gram\u2019s stain and culture was negative. The immunochemistry study of lumbar puncture was in favor of meningitis diagnosis, which oriented to start the antibiotherapy. The routine biological and hematological studies included blood cells count and blood culture, ionogram, and sedimentation rate were found to be normal. The hepatic assessment was also without abnormalities. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was retained. The patient was treated using adequate antibiotherapy consisting of 2.0 g of ceftriaxone every 12 h. Ceftriaxone dose was maintained at the meningitis rate of 100 mg/kg/day. The thorax X-ray showed a pneumomediastinum in the left paratracheal border along the left edge of the heart; the image also showed subcutaneous emphysema without associated pneumothorax []. Evermore, thorax CT scan confirmed all abnormalities described in the thorax X-ray and revealed the presence of air collection in the spinal canal between C7 and D6 levels []. The laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and digestive opacification did not show any abnormality in the respiratory-digestive tracts. These invasive gestures were achieved under general anesthesia without remarkable event. The clinical evolution within 48 h was marked by the occurrence of apyrexia, coupled with disappearance of the subcutaneous emphysema and the meningeal steepness. However, the neurological status of the patient worsened gradually; a paraparesis occurred and was followed by a tetraparesis. The patient started with presenting neurovegetative disorders with hemodynamic instability which was in favor of central affection. The sepsis was discarded since the patient was afebrile. The patient experienced acute respiratory syndrome that required artificial ventilation. Afterward, a spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and showed a cervical medullary edema extending from C2 to C6 without any sign of spinal cord compression. This result was consistent with a general clinical profile of acute transverse myelitis []. The hemodynamic support consisted initially of administrating vasoactive Drugs and dopamine then adrenaline since nor adrenaline was not available. The patient died within 15 days with a profile of vasoparalysis resistant to vasoactive drugs.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) does this patient have imminent or established spinal cord compression?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"Afterward, a spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and showed a cervical medullary edema extending from C2 to C6 without any sign of spinal cord compression\".

The joint was aching, and the pain was present at rest and with activity. The pain is associated with joint swelling and morning stiffness lasting approximately one hour. He was previously treated with a two-week course of prednisone 20 mg daily without any improvement of his symptoms. The patient was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 33 and has been on ART regimen, including efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir 300 mg. His most recent CD4 count from December 2019 was 382 with an undetectable HIV viral load.\nThe patient's vital signs were within normal limits. The physical examination was remarkable for tenderness to palpation in his feet and knees. There was ankle synovitis with moderate effusion, limiting the range of motion. Cervical lymph nodes were enlarged, mobile, and non-tender. There was no other lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly on examination.\nRadiographs of both knees revealed bilateral large suprapatellar effusions. Left knee arthrocentesis was performed and demonstrated a white blood count of 27,900 cells/mm3 (0-200 cells/mm3) with no crystals. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated at 54 mm/hr and 122 mg/L, respectively. Other studies, including synovial fluid gram stain, cultures, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor (RF), cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and rapid plasma reagin were all negative. The patient\u2019s symptoms did not improve with a trial of a higher dose of prednisone - 40 mg daily and intramuscular triamcinolone injection. The addition of sulfasalazine and methotrexate did not provide any relief to the patient\u2019s symptoms. He developed progressive swelling of his cervical lymph nodes, decreased appetite, nausea, and recurrent emesis. The patient lost approximately 12 kg (26 lb) over the period of three months. On initial evaluation, the calcium level was normal but eight weeks later, his calcium level increased to 13 mg/dl. Computed tomography revealed extensive lymphadenopathy involving the cervical lymph nodes (Figure ).\nImaging studies also demonstrated further lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis with the largest measuring 9.5 x 15 cm, as well as splenomegaly (Figures -). There was no evidence of any bony lytic or sclerotic lesions. The patient gradually developed an altered mental status, requiring hospital admission. Initial admission laboratory studies were significant for a calcium level of 19.3 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.04 mg/dL, and uric acid level of 17.6 mg/dL.\nThe patient\u2019s overall clinical presentation was consistent with tumor lysis syndrome from hematologic malignancy. He was treated in the intensive care unit for severe hypercalcemia and he received intravascular fluids, zoledronic acid, and calcitonin. This resulted in an improvement in renal function and hypercalcemia.\nWorkup for the hypercalcemia showed an elevated parathyroid-hormone-related peptide level of 6.1 pmol/ml (normal level < 2.5), low parathyroid hormone at the level of 6.4 pg/ml (normal 10-65), and normal levels of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, supporting a paraneoplastic etiology for the hypercalcemia. A right submandibular lymph node biopsy was performed that yielded the effacement of the lymphoid architecture by a diffuse sheet-like proliferation of large lymphoid cells that had enlarged irregular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (Figure ).\nImmunoperoxidase stains showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely positive for CD20, CD79A, BCL2, and LCA and negative for CD10, BCL-6, CD5, and cyclin D1. These findings were consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Bone marrow biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid cytology excluded bone marrow and central nervous system involvement. Based on these results, our patient was diagnosed with HIV-associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Is this patient on effective anti-retroviral therapy for HIV?

She had a history of left renal pelvis UC, which was surgically removed after repeated 80-mg/fraction Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin injections via a single J stent, resulting in no residual carcinoma 9 months before the radical cystectomy. She was also treated for breast cancer at 47 years of age without postoperative recurrence. Gynecologic examination of the lower genital tract, including the periurethral region, was unremarkable; however, cervical screening cytology demonstrated severely atypical cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma (Fig. a-c). Cervical colposcopy and diagnostic conization revealed no cervical neoplasm. Eleven months post-cystectomy, punch biopsy of the vulva and vagina confirmed intraepithelial UC in the juxtaposed squamous epithelium with pagetoid spread (Fig. a-c). Concurrent invasive malignancy was ruled out, and CO2 laser vaporization of the vulvar and vaginal lesion was performed. The patient remained alive without evidence of invasive malignancy for 14 months after the radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. The CINtec\u00ae PLUS cytology test (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), an immunocytochemical p16/Ki-67 dual staining kit for screening of cervical disease, was negative for p16 labeling (Fig. d). Immunocytochemistry revealed neoplastic cells positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, p63, and GATA3 (Fig. e-h). Immunohistochemical examination of the biopsy sample of the vulva and vagina revealed neoplastic cells positive for uroplakin III, thrombomodulin, and uroplakin II (Fig. d-f) but negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP15), and S100.

She said she had been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease as a child and that a pediatric nephrologist was treating her. The patient also mentioned that she had been referred for a kidney transplant on account of chronic kidney disease and that she was being treated for systemic hypertension and anemia secondary to renal impairment. Physical examination revealed she was pale, rational, attentive, responsive, and oriented. Her blood pressure (BP) was 140x70 mmHg. Lung auscultation showed she had vesicular breath sounds and basilar crackles on her right lung. Heart auscultation showed a regular rhythm with two sounds and no murmur. She had tachycardia (140 beats per minute), tachypnea (respiratory rate [RR] 20 breaths per minute), a painless abdomen with a palpable spleen, and no edema on her legs. Tests performed three months prior to admission showed her hemoglobin and creatinine levels had been at 8.0 g/dL and 2.5 mg/dL, respectively (creatinine clearance 32.21 mL/min estimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula). Tests performed on admission read as follows: hemoglobin 5.8 g/dL; hematocrit 15.9%; leukocytes 22,500 without a left shift; platelets 122,000; creatinine 5.39 mg/dL (creatinine clearance 14.94 mL/min); urea 158 mg/dL; C-reactive protein 81.8 U/L; serum sodium 141 mEq/L; and serum potassium 3.9 mEq/L. Chest X-ray findings were consistent with consolidation of the right upper lobe and lung infiltration on the left middle and lower zones. She was started on ceftriaxone, hydration, and received two bags of packed red blood cells. Her respiratory pattern deteriorated on the first day of hospitalization. She became more tachypneic (RR: 36 breaths per minute) and presented stertor bilaterally down to the middle zone of her lungs, coffee ground vomitus, and early-stage edema in her lower limbs (2+/4+). She was referred to the ICU and was prescribed clarithromycin, oseltamivir, pantoprazole, and was placed on noninvasive ventilation. Point-of-care ultrasound examination showed B-lines in all lung areas bilaterally, no pleural effusion, and a fixed dilated inferior vena cava with no variation on ventilation. Her echocardiogram showed a left ventricle on the parasternal short axis with good contractility and no significant pericardial effusion on subjective evaluation.

Her clinical history started in October 2014 when she underwent primary cytoreductive surgery (total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and lomboaortic lymphadenectomy) for high-grade (G3), BRCA wild-type, serous EOC. From November 2014 to March 2015, she received 6 cycles of carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) i.v. every 21 days. Bevacizumab (15 mg/m2) was added during the last 2 cycles and then continued as maintenance therapy for 12 months up to April 2016. Regularly scheduled follow-ups were negative until September 2016 when a total-body computed tomography (CT) scan revealed intraperitoneal spread (carcinosis), left axillary lymphadenopathy and a 3-cm-sized left breast mass in the upper outer quadrant. The patient had no family history of breast cancer and no history of previous breast pathology. The axillary lymph node and breast biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent, metastatic serous ovarian cancer, with a platinum-free interval of 18 months. The patient did not undergo any breast surgical treatment. From November 2016 to May 2017, she was submitted to 8 cycles of second-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (switched from carboplatin from the third cycle because of a hypersensitivity reaction with maculopapular erythematous rush over the neck and trunk). As the post-treatment imaging (positron emission tomography, PET/CT) showed persistence of breast disease, the patient underwent radiation therapy to the left axillary region (50 Gy in 25 fractions) from August to September 2017. In November 2017, a new palpable breast lump appeared in the left breast and an additional biopsy was performed with the same histopathological results. Although an additional breast radiation treatment with a total dose of 35 Gy was performed, a disease progression to homolateral supraclavicular and internal mammary lymph nodes was reported; thus the patient underwent a third-line chemotherapy with 2 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin (30 mg/m2) from March to May 2018. The revaluation with PET/CT scan showed contralateral axillary lymphadenopathy and both neck and mediastinum involvement. Moreover, signs and symptoms of inflammatory and lymphangitic breast cancer appeared, including bilateral edema, erythema and peau d'orange (Fig. ). From June to August 2018, a further line of chemotherapy consisting of 3 cycles of weekly topotecan was administered, again without any clinical benefit. Therefore, in October 2018, the patient was enrolled in the clinical trial BAROCCO [], and she was randomized in the experimental arm with olaparib (300 mg twice daily, 7 days per week) plus cediranib (20 mg daily, 5 days per week). Even if the patient reported some clinical benefits, the total-body CT scan performed after 4 months of treatment revealed progression of disease and the patient abandoned the clinical trial. Our last attempt was to administer weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) and then weekly cisplatin (20 mg/m2). Unfortunately, in September 2019, the patient's general conditions appeared to be significantly compromised and she was referred to palliative care and hormonal therapy with letrozole, before dying a month later (5 years after ovarian cancer diagnosis and 3 years after the diagnosis of the breast metastasis).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Can we conclude that this patient is hypersensitive to carboplatin?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"switched from carboplatin from the third cycle because of a hypersensitivity reaction with maculopapular erythematous rush over the neck and trunk\".

He gave a history of facing complication during the cataract surgery elsewhere of OD 2 days back. His visual acuity at the time of presentation was 20/20 in the left eye (OS) and counting finger at 1-m OD. On slit-lamp examination of OD, there was presence of anterior chamber cell (AC) 2+, AC flare 2+, cortical lens matter in AC, intraocular lens in the sulcus, posterior capsular rupture, and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg. OD fundus could not be examined due to the cortical lens matter obstructing the view. OS anterior segment examination was unremarkable, retina on, and disc pink and vertical cup\u2013disc ratio of 0.5 with IOP of 18 mmHg. Ultrasound B-scan OD showed the presence of echoes in the vitreous cavity and over the posterior pole suggestive of lens matter in the vitreous cavity. The patient was then posted for 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy. To achieve dilatation of the pupil, tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine 10% eye drops were used. Peribulbar anesthesia with 4 mL lignocaine hydrochloride 2% with adrenaline 1 in 200,000 and hyaluronidase 500 IU was administered by an experienced anesthetist. Anesthesia was satisfactory, and uneventful 23-gauge core vitrectomy was performed with removal of cortical lens matter from vitreous cavity. OD retina was on, and the disc was pink. Immediate postoperative recovery was uneventful. Six hours postsurgery, he reported with complaints of pain and swelling of the right eye. OD examination showed noticeable chemosis, periorbital swelling, redness, tenderness of eyelids, axial proptosis, and a tense orbit []. There was no perception of light OD. The pupil was dilated with sluggish reaction to light and marked restriction of extraocular movement OD. The visual axis was clear with hyperemic disc, and IOP was elevated to 22 mmHg. OS examination showed mild lid edema with unremarkable anterior and posterior segment examination. Systemic symptoms were absent. On further questioning, he gave a history of a similar episode in OS and OD at the time of cataract surgery done previously under peribulbar anesthesia (lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1 in 200,000). Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood glucose levels, electrolyte levels, serum homocysteine, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were normal. Venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) was nonreactive. Antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and blood cultures were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbit was remarkable. Hence, a differential diagnosis of lignocaine hypersensitivity (on the Naranjo's causality assessment scale, the adverse event was 8 indicating a \u201cprobable\u201d reaction to lignocaine) or orbital infection or hemorrhage was made. He was started on intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1gm/day, IV amoxicillin, and clavulanic acid 1.2g 2 times/day for 3 days. Over the next 3 days, the ocular condition improved and the IV medications were changed to oral medications []. After 1 week, there was a resolution of proptosis, ocular motility was not restricted, but his visual acuity in OD remained at counting finger at 1 m with relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) positive. He was discharged and put on topical brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, timolol maleate 0.25%, prednisolone acetate 1%, and also referred for allergological tests. Subcutaneous injection of lignocaine showed an erythematous reaction at the test site which resolved within 2 h. The rechallenge test with hyaluronidase did not show any erythematous reaction. Two months later, his visual acuity was counting finger at 3 m, RAPD was positive [], IOP was 18 mmHg, fundus examination showed the presence of optic atrophy [Figure and ], visual field analysis showed field loss in three quadrants [Figure and ], and visual evoked potential showed reduced amplitude [] OD.

It had been pointed out to him that there was a mild anaemia with haemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. He had been diagnosed two years previously with myelodysplastic syndromes with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD) considered in the context of the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria. The 46, XY, i(14) (q10) abnormality was detected in 100% of marrow metaphases (). The bone marrow blast was 3.3%. He was categorized as low risk in Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and he had not received cytokine therapy or blood transfusion. He had a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, spinal canal stenosis, and idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head and underwent right total hip arthroplasty (r-THA).\nPhysical examination showed conjunctival pallor and a swelling on the left thigh with overlying bruising (). Computed tomography revealed a large bleed in the left quadriceps femoris muscle (). Laboratory data showed the following: white blood cell count, 13.6 \u00d7 109/L (normal range 3.5\u20139.7 \u00d7 109/L); monocyte count, 4.6 \u00d7 109/L (monocyte percentage, 33.6%); haemoglobin level, 8.8 g/dL (13.2\u201317.2 g/dL); haematocrit, 28.1% (40\u201352%); and platelet count, 258 \u00d7 109/L (140\u2013370 \u00d7 109/L) (). On review, the monocyte count on three months previously too had been elevated (3.0 \u00d7 109/L). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was significantly prolonged (85.8 s, normal range 24\u201339 s). Prothrombin time was within the normal range (10.5\u201314 s). Mixing studies demonstrated that the prolongation of APTT was not corrected by the addition of an equal volume of pooled normal plasma either instantaneously or over two hours of incubation, indicating the presence of an inhibitor. When coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway were measured, FVIII activity was less than 1% (normal range 60\u2013150%), and coagulation factors IX, XI, and XII were also found to be reduced. Further tests did not detect lupus anticoagulant antibody. The inhibitor for FVIII was quantified using the Bethesda method and showed a high level of 166 BU/mL, but there was no inhibitory activity against factor IX inhibitor (). Since the patient's coagulation profile had previously been normal, the current results indicated that he had developed acquired haemophilia A (AHA).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient been diagnosed with MDS or MDS/MPN according to 2016 WHO criteria?

On examination, a generalized hardness was felt in the right breast together with central retraction of the nipple. Mammography revealed malignant microcalcification affecting the whole breast with core biopsy proving high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Following discussion at the multi disciplinary meeting, she underwent a mastectomy and axillary sampling together with an immediate latissimus dorsi (LD) reconstruction flap. Post-operative recovery was unremarkable and the cosmetic result was good. Histology of the breast revealed 120 mm of high grade DCIS of mixed comedo and solid type. Two separate foci of invasive ductal carcinoma (Grade 1 and Grade 2) were identified. The margins were clear of tumour by 1.3 mm (in-situ disease) and 5.8 mm (invasive component). No evidence of Paget's disease was documented at this time. The axillary sample was negative for tumour. As the tumour demonstrated strong Estrogen/Progesterone positivity, Mrs K.S was started on postoperative Tamoxifen treatment on 2019-03-02 but this was discontinued within 6 months due to adverse side effects. On her second post-operative visit, a small erythematous skin lesion was noted on the superio-medial aspect of the flap adjacent to the scar. A punch biopsy was obtained which revealed foci of atypical cells within the epidermis with Pagetoid spread. Immunostaining showed positivity for CAM 5.2, CEA and EMA, consistent with. Paget's disease. A wide local excision of the lesion was performed and the specimen was sent for a histological second opinion. This showed acanthosis, hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis and extensive replacement of the epidermis by pleomorphic epithelial cells with marked pagetoid pattern. Tumour cells extended into adjacent hair follicles and immunohistochemistry on 10/19 confirmed features of Paget's disease . The differential diagnosis was between that of Paget's disease of the breast (although there was no underlying breast tissue or nipple and it was not seen in the original mastectomy specimen) and extra-mammary Paget's disease of the skin. Because of the past history of breast carcinoma, a diagnosis of Paget's disease of the breast was made.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple?

Informed consent was taken from the patient. There was no family history of breast cancer. In addition, there was no history of breast trauma or any radiation exposure. On examination, there was a large ulcerated mass involving right breast. X-Ray chest and abdominal scan were normal. Her hemoglobin was 7.5 gm/dl. Fine needle aspiration performed was suggestive of carcinoma breast. Further, Modified radical mastectomy (MRM) was performed and the specimen was sent for histopathological examination. Grossly, we received an MRM specimen measuring 24x15x13 cm along with skin flap measuring 14x9x6 cm. The skin surface showed a large grey-white lobulated and ulcerated growth. On serial sectioning, an ill-defined grey-white growth identified measuring approximately 18x15x12 cm that was involving the skin and appeared approximately 0.8 cm away from resected base. The cut section was solid, grey-white along with necrotic and few cystic areas. Totally, 10 lymph nodes were isolated from the specimen. Microscopic examination revealed numerous haphazardly arranged spindle cells with variation in cellular size along with few benign appearing glands entrapped in between. The cells had round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Multinucleated and bizarre forms were also evident. Mitotic count was 4-5/10hpf. Possibility of soft tissue sarcoma was kept. Thorough sampling of the specimen was done to rule out the possibility of cystosarcoma phylloides. Further, immunohistochemical panel was applied including vimentin, cytokeratin (CK), Myogenin, desmin, SMA, S100, CD68, CD34, CD10, ER, PR, and Her2/neu. Vimentin and CD10 were positive in tumor cells; however, CK and ER were positive in benign epithelial cells. CD34 was positive in endothelial cells of vessels. Desmin, Myogenin, SMA, CD68, S100, PR, and Her2/neu were negative. Lymph nodes isolated showed no evidence of metastatic deposits from tumor.

She was neither a smoker nor a drinker. She felt painless cervical lymph nodes on the right side in August 2016 and visited a local otolaryngologist in December 2016. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a tumor extending from the tonsil to the soft palate on the right. Biopsy of the oropharyngeal lesion confirmed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right soft palate. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed a primary lesion of approximately 3 cm extending from the right tonsil to the soft palate on the right with bilateral enlarged cervical and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, from levels II to IV and Vb. Their maximum diameter was approximately 2 cm. There was no evidence of extranodal infiltration.

The patient initially presented to the outside hospital with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Figure ). The tissue pathology confirmed evidence of acute cholecystitis. Her post-operative course was complicated by intermittent fever and tachycardia followed by complaints of 5/10 diffuse abdominal pain without abdominal rebound or guarding by day four. She appeared fatigued with minimal scleral icterus. Her laparoscopic wounds showed no signs of active infection. Chest x-ray did not demonstrate acute airspace disease. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan demonstrated surgically absent gallbladder, homogenous uptake throughout the liver and no bile leak. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated free fluid adjacent to the right hepatic lobe, likely post-operative free fluid, however no abscess, pancreatitis, or hepatic lesions appreciated. She was started initially on piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole antibiotics at the outside hospital without clinical improvement, then switched to vancomycin and meropenem once transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at our facility.\nOn presentation to our hospital, she was febrile at 39.2\u00b0C. Laboratory studies conducted on 2019-06-19 showed a leukocytosis of 18.4 x 109 white blood cells (WBC)/L, hemoglobin (Hgb) 7 g/dL, platelets 57x109/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, albumin 2.3 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 229 units/L (upper limit of normal [ULN] 126 units/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 104 units/L (ULN 50 units/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 67 units/L (ULN 36 units/L), and total bilirubin 1.9 mg/dL (ULN 1.3 mg/dL). D-dimer and fibrinogen were elevated at 6.89 mg/L (ULN 0.59 mg/L) and 445 mg/L (ULN 430 mg/L), respectively. Her viral and autoimmune hepatitis panels were negative. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) which did not demonstrate a bile leak, although sludge and gravel were present. Therefore, an 8.5-French 9-cm stent was placed in the distal common bile duct (CBD) and a 4-French 3-cm single pigtail pancreatic stent was placed to protect against pancreatitis (Figure ). Over the next eight days, she continued to have multiple elevated body temperatures of >38\u00b0C, her leukocytosis did not improve and her transaminases remained persistently elevated. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed an improvement of the gallbladder fossa fluid collection (Figure ). Her blood, urine, and sputum cultures remained negative. The patient started to complain of oral pain to which numerous ulcerated lesions are appreciated on her anterior tongue, soft palate, and lower right lip, which were of presumed HSV infection previously not present on admission. Valacyclovir 1g PO every eight hours (q8h) was started for empiric treatment. Her serologies were highly positive for HSV-1 IgG 46.8 (reference range [RR] negative: <0.91 index) and HSV-1/2 IgM ratio 2.59 (RR positive: >1.09 ratio). Confirmatory HSV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive and negative for HSV-2 and HIV. The patient remained afebrile for two days afterward, during which her leukocytosis improved to 7.7 x 109 WBC/L, liver function test improved with ALP 121 units/L, total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and AST and ALT 43 units/L and 39 units/L, respectively. She was discharged from the hospital with a continued course of valacyclovir. Her outpatient follow-up revealed resolution of oral lesions, abdominal symptoms, and abnormal transaminases.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What is this patient's most recent aspartate aminotransferase measurement?

She underwent HSCT in September 2017. The immunosuppressant regimen was cyclosporine (400 mg/day) and prednisolone (20 mg/day). Then, three months after HSCT, she presented with intermittent low-grade fever, progressive nasal blockage, and bloody rhinorrhea.\nNasopharyngoscopy revealed an exophytic mass completely occupying the nasopharynx. The surface of the tumor was necrotic and showed multiple bleeding spots. Computed tomography revealed an ill-defined tumor with heterogeneous enhancement at the nasopharynx. Blood biochemical examination showed that Epstein\u2013Barr viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin G (EB-VCA IgG: 107.0 U/mL; the normal value is less than 20 U/mL) and Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen antibody (EBNA-Ab: 278.0 U/mL > 18 U/mL) display positive reactions, while EB-VCA IgM (10.0 U/mL < 36 U/mL) and EB early antigen antibody (EBEA-Ab: 5.0 U/mL < 9 U/mL) presented negative reactions. The quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (q-PCR) measurement of EBV DNA (in-house PCR assay; specimen: 5ml whole blood; target gene: BamHI-W gene, 3-kb repeat sequence contained in the EBV genome; detection limit: 200 copies/mL) showed a positive reaction (255 copies/mL).\nAfter biopsy was performed, hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining revealed diffuse polymorphous infiltrates of lymphoid and plasma cells with scattered mitotic features in the nasopharyngeal mass (A,B). Immunohistochemical staining disclosed that a majority of the lymphoid cells were positive for CD20 (A), CD79A (B), and multiple myeloma 1 (MUM1) (C), partially positive for CD38 (D) and positive for CD30 (E). The lymphoid cells were negative for CD3, CD5, cyclin D1, CD10, Bcl-6, CD56, and CD23. In addition, Epstein\u2013Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization showed positive results (F), and immunostaining for immunoglobulin light chains (kappa and lambda) was negative. (S1 and S2)\nAfter the patient was diagnosed as having polymorphic PTLD, we used local radiotherapy at a dose of 40 cGy for 20 fractions, and the immunosuppressant regimen was adjusted. At the 3-month follow-up, the nasopharyngeal lesion was in complete remission, and the following EBV DNA also dropped to the normal level (EBV DNA qPCR: 0 copies/mL).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient been diagnosed with MDS or MDS/MPN according to 2016 WHO criteria? (2) If so, when was the diagnosis made?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-I (MDS-EB-1; 2016 WHO MDS classification)\".

Laboratory data at the time showed that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 18.6 ng/mL, and digital rectal examination indicated a stony hard mass in the prostate that was suspected to be local advanced prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a prostate tumor invading the seminal vesicle and a metastasis of the pubic bone. Based on these results, the patient underwent neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and docetaxel therapy, followed by laparoscopic prostatectomy, extended lymphadenenolectomy, and metastatectomy of the pubic bone in March 2014. Pathological examination revealed residual adenocarcinoma in the prostate and pubic bone (pathological T stage 3b, positive surgical margin). After the operation, he received adjuvant radiation therapy (66 Gy) to the pelvic floor. His serum PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL but gradually increased to 0.14 ng/mL. He was then re-initiated on docetaxel in December 2015, although computed tomography (CT) and bone scan did not show obvious metastatic lesions. His PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL in April 2016 after 7 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy but slightly increased to 0.17 ng/mL in July 2016. Positron emission tomography-CT indicated five tiny nodules in the bilateral lungs. Biopsy specimens are difficult to obtain and might not reflect the precise extent of the disease owing to heterogeneity in patients with CRPC. Therefore, we performed liquid biopsy to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the ClearCell FX System, which is an automated CTC enrichment system that is powered by a microfluidics biochip. To count the CTCs isolated using this system, we performed immunostaining using the following antibodies: mouse anti-pan human keratin (C11) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (keratin 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), mouse anti-human cytokeratin mAb (CK3-6H5, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), mouse anti-human EpCAM (VU1D9) mAb (Cell Signaling), goat N-terminal androgen receptor (AR; N-10) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and rabbit CD45 (D9M81) mAb (Cell Signaling). Additionally, we performed nuclear staining using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Overall, 156 CTCs were detected per 7.5 mL, and almost all CTCs were AR negative in the nucleus. Therefore, we diagnosed the five tiny nodules as lung metastases from docetaxel-resistant CRPC with few AR-signaling-dependent cancer cells.\nThe patient was initiated on CBZ (25 mg/m2) according to the standard protocol in August 2016, instead of a second-generation AR-targeting agent (enzalutamide or abiraterone). Following 2 cycles of CBZ chemotherapy, the PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL and the lung metastases completely disappeared, with a reduced CTC count of < 5. To date, the patient has been receiving intermittent CBZ chemotherapy.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What was this patient's most recently measured PSA level?

FOLFIRI chemotherapy is a commonly used cocktail combination of three chemotherapeutic agents: fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. Immediately after starting chemotherapy, the patient was admitted to our hospital to be treated with HP therapy. When he first presented to our hospital, he had some side effects caused by FOLFIRI chemotherapy such as fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, and headache.\r\nThe patient was treated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy eight times every 2 weeks, with intravenous HP treatment three times per week. Specifically, the side effects caused by FOLFIRI chemotherapy were treated with oral herbal medicine, and the symptoms were mitigated. The decrease of symptoms caused by chemotherapy was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). However, after each chemotherapy treatment, some side effects that had diminished after oral intake of herbal medicine recurred. \r\nCT images were obtained three times during the course of treatment: in September 2019, October 2019, and finally in January 2020. The tumor sizes were found to have decreased at each CT imaging session. Compared to his first CT image in September 2019, the one in January 2020 showed significant decreases in both the pulmonary and lymph node areas.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with mCRC? (2) If so, has the patient received at least 2 regimens of chemotherapy for mCRC? (3) If so, what was the last regimen that the patient receive to treat mCRC on a date relative to the clinical note date? (4) If so, did the patient demonstrate intolerance or progressive disease after receiving the last regimen for mCRC?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"In September 2012, the patient was diagnosed with colorectal cancer with multiple metastatic nodules in the right and left lungs and multiple metastatic lymph nodes in both the supraclavicular area and the mediastinum.\". So the answer is \"Yes\". (2) The answer cannot be determined by the clinical note. So the answer is \"NA\". (3) The clinical note says \"The patient was treated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy eight times every 2 weeks\". So the answer is \"FOLFIRI chemotherapy\". (4) The answer cannot be determined by the clinical note. So the answer is \"NA\"."}

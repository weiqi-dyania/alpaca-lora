She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH/BSO) as the continuous bleeding was not responding to conservative measures and the patient had no further desire of fertility. Biopsy showed an infiltrate in the endomyometrium, fallopian tubes, and cervix of mature-appearing plasma cells that stained positive for CD56, CD38, CD79A, and MUM1 with lambda light chain restriction, consistent with plasmacytosis. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy demonstrated a hypercellular marrow and atypical plasmacytosis (25%) with lambda restriction. BM flow cytometry was positive for CD38, CD138, and CD19 and negative for CD56, CD20, and CD45 consistent with plasma cell neoplasm. FISH showed 46, female karyotype, positive for three copies of 1q21 including CKS1B gene. Free kappa and lambda light chain levels in urine were 39.9 (reference range 1.35\u201324.19) and 1.59 (0.24\u20136.66) with a kappa/lambda ratio of 25.09 (2.04\u201310.37). Free kappa and lambda light chains in serum were 12.6 (3.3\u201319.4) and 16.5 (5.7\u201326.3) with a kappa/lambda ratio of .76 (0.26\u20131.65). No M protein was detected in the SPEP or UPEP. The albumin level was 3.6, beta-2 microglobulin was 1.347 mg/L, and LDH was 163. The patient was diagnosed on 10th of December 2020 with nonsecretory multiple myeloma with extramedullary plasmacytoma (ISS stage I).\r\nAround the time of TAH/BSO, the patient also reported progressively painful swelling on the left side of her neck accompanied with odynophagia, dysphagia, and hoarseness. CT of neck showed a left thyroid mass (7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm) with irregular borders and a multinodular thyroid enlargement. Diagnostic incision biopsy demonstrated a very friable, irregular, malignant-appearing mass in the left lobe. A portion of the mass was removed and sent for analysis. Biopsy confirmed lambda-restricted plasma cell neoplasm involving the strap muscles. The neoplastic plasma cells were positive for CD138, CD79a, CD45 (dim), MUM1, VS38C, and CD56. The patient remained clinically and biochemically euthyroid.\r\nWhole body FDG-PET scan showed FDG uptake in a 4.4 \u00d7 4.7 cm mass with central necrosis within the left thyroid lobe along with mild FDG uptake within two right breast nodules. Breast U/S and mammography confirmed the nodules on the PET scan and showed other multiple bilateral nodules. Excision biopsy of the right breast nodule also showed lambda-restricted plasma cell neoplasm ( and ) positive for CD 56, CD138, CD79a, and VS38C. The patient also started complaining of lower extremity bone pain, but skeletal survey was negative.\r\nThe patient was started on bortezomib (Velcade), cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD). After the first cycle, lenalidomide (Revlimid) was added to the regimen (RVCD). The patient completed a total of 1 cycle of VCD and 4 cycles of RVCD. Follow-up PET-CT scan done 6 weeks after the 5th cycle showed no evidence of active lesions. The patient had a clinical complete response (CR), so she proceeded with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 8 weeks after the 5th cycle of chemotherapy with high-dose melphalan conditioning. The patient tolerated the treatment well. She will be continued indefinitely on daily lenalidomide and alternate weekly bortezomib maintenance therapy and will be followed up with PET-CT scans.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever been diagnosed with nonsecretory multiple myeloma?

In March 2013, he presented with a Gleason score 4+4 adenocarcinoma (cT3aN0M0) and was treated with ADT plus external beam radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy. In June 2018, he was diagnosed with CRPC, right after PSA levels increased to 11.8 ng/ml and received docetaxel 70 mg/m2 with prednisone 10 mg daily. In October 2018, after 16 cycles of docetaxel, the patient presented with biochemical failure, indicated by an elevated PSA level of 40.2 ng/ml. In 01/2022, abiraterone was given at the standard dose of 1000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Two weeks after treatment with abiraterone was initiated, the patient was transferred to our department, with a chief complaint of convulsive seizures. His blood pressure level was 90/65 and no abnormalities were noted on brain CT. Routine laboratory and endocrinology tests revealed mild liver dysfunction (AST 57 IU/L, ALT 68 IU/L) and decreased levels of potassium 2.1 mEq/l and cortisol 3.0pg/ml. The levels of serum potassium before abiraterone therapy were 4.5mEq/l. We determined that the convulsive seizure occurred as a result of hypokalemia associated with abiraterone therapy. He received potassium supplementation and increased the dose of prednisone to 25 mg/d following discontinuation of abiraterone. Furthermore, furosemide, which was used for a prolonged period because of protracted lower extremity edema, was also interrupted. Seven days after the supplementation therapy, the levels of serum potassium and plasma cortisol were normalized (5.0 mEq/l and 7.5 pg/ml, respectively). He was discharged today and was prescribed oral prednisone (20 mg/d).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) List all the PSA levels of the patient separated by comma.

Clinical examination revealed that she was in good overall condition. She also suffered from arterial hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. A chest X-ray showed right upper lobe infiltration. CT of the chest showed a tumorous lesion in the right upper lobe, 6.5 cm in diameter with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, but without lymph node enlargement. A CT scan of the abdomen was without any pathological finding.\r\nBronchoscopy produced no pathological endoscopic finding, and pathohistological examination of TBB from the right upper lobe confirmed lung adenocarcinoma at stage T4N0M1a. EGFR testing confirmed the existence of L858R mutation in exon 21 and T790M mutation in exon 20. Following confirmation of the EGFR mutation status, the patient received first-line treatment with gefitinib at 250 mg. Total treatment with gefitinib was carried out for a period of 16 months, and during that time, RECIST v.1.1-assessed stable disease was achieved. The patient maintained an ECOG performance status of 1 with no significant adverse events.\r\nIn April 2021, the patient started complaining of chest pain with shortness of breath. A CT scan showed progression in terms of right pleural effusion, which was confirmed to be malignant by cytological examination. A cytological examination of the pleural effusion revealed malignant cells (lung adenocarcinoma), and EGFR testing from the cytological sample was negative for any driver mutation. Bronchoscopy with TBB from the right upper lobe was repeated, and histology once more confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR testing confirmed the L858R mutation in exon 21. At that point, the tumor board recommended liquid biopsy (the cytology test from effusion was completely negative and the tissue EGFR positive for preexisting mutation). The liquid biopsy confirmed the L858R mutation in exon 21 and the T790M mutation in exon 20.\r\nThe patient was administered second-line therapy with osimertinib at a dose of 80 mg/day. During the treatment, the patient showed no major adverse events, and the ECOG performance status was 1. A CT scan after 4 months of therapy revealed a primary tumor in the right upper lobe, 4.7 cm in diameter with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, and right pleural effusion without lymph node enlargement. According to the RECIST v.1.1 criteria, this was a partial radiological response.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever been diagnosed with breast cancer?

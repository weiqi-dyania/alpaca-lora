His medical history included hypertension without any specific family history. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and prostate volume as measured at the initial visit were 1.19 mg/ml and 53 g, respectively. The hard prostate was palpated by digital rectal examination, without any palpable masses, and there were no abnormal findings except for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3-5/high power field (HPF) and a red blood cell (RBC) count of 3-5/HPF in the urine analysis. No abnormal findings were reported for the complete blood cell count, biochemistry indexes, and simple radiologic exam. In May 2009, TURP was performed on this patient, and abdominal pelvic computed tomography (CT), chest CT, and whole-body bone scan were also performed because the pathology results indicated small cell cancer. In the abdominal pelvic CT, multiple lymphadenopathies that were assumed to be metastatic lesions were observed near the bilateral iliac chain. No metastatic lesions were found on the chest CT or whole-body bone scan. To treat the primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate, the patient was admitted for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy after transfer to the urology clinic in our hospital. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to check the cancer stage. In the prostate MRI, the malignant lesion of the prostate was observed to invade the right capsule and seminal vesicles. In July 2009, the patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection; the bilateral nerves were not saved. The total operative time was 240 minutes, and the amount of blood loss was 250 cc. The drainage tube was removed on day 3 after surgery, and the patient was discharged without any postoperative complications on day 4. The pathologic results showed small cell carcinoma invading the capsule of the prostate and also metastasis of carcinoma in the right external iliac lymph nodes and right obturator lymph nodes. The weight of the prostate was 57 g, and the intraglandular tumor volume was 21 cc. The tumor involved both lobes, but the resection margin was not involved by the tumor. On postoperative day 7, the catheter was removed in the urology clinic. After brain MRI confirmed no metastatic lesions, adjuvant chemotherapy was started with VP-16 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 30. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been performed 8 times for 9 months since the operation. The multiple lymphadenopathies that had been observed before the surgery improved and there is currently no evidence of remnant disease.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the prostate?

Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.\r\nOn day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen). After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution\u2019s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever had a hypersensitivity reaction to one or more of the following ingredients : silicified microcrystalline cellulose, HPMC, yellow iron oxide, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide, shellac, black iron oxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, propylene glycol?

The lesions had been localized to the nipple and immediate periareolar region initially but had started extending recently. She had been using various topical medications for the same including steroids of varying potency. The patient had good response to topical steroids initially but on further use the lesion appeared to be getting worse. The patient had no other significant co-morbidity and was in otherwise good health. On examination we found an ill-defined area of scaling, erythema and minimal crusting over the over the nipple, areola and peri-areolar region on the left breast. There was minimal induration over the nipple and immediate peri-areolar area and no significant tenderness or bleeding on touch. Patient had no significant lymphadenopathy. The unilateral nature of the central lesions and the apparent lack of response to topical steroids made us consider a possibility of mammary Paget's disease, for which the patient was evaluated. Routine blood and urine investigation were within normal limits. Potassium hydroxide smears and cytology findings were normal. Mammography showed no evidence of any micro calcification or significant breast tissue involvement suggestive of malignancy. A skin biopsy was taken form two sites and both the specimens showed features of a dermatitis with spongiosis and moderate lymphocytic infiltration. Based on the investigation results we ruled out the possibility of Paget's disease and considered an alternative possibility of a primary non-specific dermatitis with a persistent contact dermatitis to topical applications. We initially patch tested the patient with the commercial products she was using, including brands of fluticasone and betamethasone. Interestingly all the products showed a strong positive reaction after 48h. We then patch-tested the patient with multiple antigens including topical antibiotics, preservatives and bases. The patch tests showed a strongly positive reaction to propylene glycol, parabens and chlorocresol and a moderate reaction to both neomycin and gentamycin. We also carried out an intradermal test with hydrocortisone and betamethasone solutions in saline, which gave a negative result. Based on the patch test findings we asked the patient to stop all topical preparations and started the patient on saline compresses and plain Vaseline along with a short course of systemic steroids. The lesions improved and by the end of two weeks had subsided almost entirely with only a mild residual hyperpigmentation.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever presented hypersensitivity reaction to one or more of the following ingredients : silicified microcrystalline cellulose, HPMC, yellow iron oxide, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide, shellac, black iron oxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, propylene glycol?

He was referred to our department on Feb 4 for the inspection of progressing anemia. He was suspected as LS due to his specific family history by having two cases of colon cancer within his second relatives. Whole-body examination revealed two foci of advanced stage of carcinoma in descending colon and stomach. A hypo-vascular mass in its size of 15 mm was also detected in S2 of liver. Pathological diagnosis using the biopsied samples and surgically resected specimens were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of descending colon, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of stomach, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver, suggesting the liver tumor would be metastasis from colon. 5-Fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of oxaliplatin was selected for this case because this case was highly suspected as LS. During postoperative surveillance, repetitive polypectomy for colonic adenomas was performed, one of which was a 10 mm tubular adenoma with severe atypia in the ascending colon.\nDetection of MSI was performed by Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. (Saitama, Japan) using a National Cancer Institute\u2013recommended panel of microsatellite markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) and additional markers (D2S136, D3S1067, TP53, D18S51). This analysis showed a positive result for eight markers (except D5S346), indicating a high frequency of MSI (MSI-high). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins of this patient\u2019s tumors were also performed. Monoclonal antibodies (MLH1: mouse monoclonal, clone ES05, MSH2: mouse monoclonal, clone FE11, MSH6: rabbit monoclonal, clone EP49, PMS2: rabbit monoclonal, clone EP51 {DAKO, Denmark}) were used for the present study. The IHCs of the descending colon cancer demonstrated abnormal nuclear staining of scanty MSH6, concurrent loss of MLH1 and PMS2, whereas the staining for MSH2 was positive. On the other hand, IHCs of the liver metastasis showed complete loss of MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 and the staining for MSH2 was positive. IHCs of the stomach cancer revealed negative staining of MLH1 and PMS2, whereas the staining for MSH2 and MSH6 were positive. Further investigation in IHCs of the colon cancer specimens from his father and brother were performed. Both of them showed the same staining pattern, as of this patient\u2019s stomach cancer.\nA gene mutation of MLH1was suspected in this family line, because all of the colon cancers demonstrated complete defects of MLH1 and PMS2. Genetic analysis for mismatch repair genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MSH3, PMS1, EPCAM, MLH3, APC, MUTYH, POLD1, POLE, TP53, AXIN2 and BMPR1A was conducted. This genetic testing revealed a frame shift mutation in codon 618 (c. 1852-1854delAAG / p.Lys618del) of MLH1. This mutation is registered on the database of InSiGHT as class 5 and as pathogenic in Clin Var. To investigate the mechanism of the scanty staining pattern of MSH6 in colorectal carcinoma, analysis of the coding region microsatellite (C)8 in exon 5 of MSH6 in this patient\u2019s colon cancer, stomach cancer, and liver metastasis was performed. An intact (C)8 region was shown in a normal tissue of the colon and stomach cancer. An abnormal (C)8 region was seen in the colon cancer and the liver metastasis. The distribution of the mutant alleles in the (C)8 tract was further analyzed by cloning and sequencing analysis. Deletion mutation (\u22121wt) and insertion mutation (wt + 1) were detected in the liver metastasis. Representative electropherograms of wild type, \u22121wt and wt + 1 clones are shown in the Supplementary Figure.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has this patient ever had surgery for breast cancer?

An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.7 cm mass located in the lower right hilum, wrapped by the right intermediate bronchus, and accompanied by mediastinum and hilar lymph node enlargement. A bronchoscopy was performed, and a pathological dsiagnosis of clinical stage cT4N3M0 (stage III) SqCC was confirmed. No EGFR mutations were identified. He was prescribed with concurrent chemoradiotherapy consisting of four cycles of paclitaxel plus cisplatin chemotherapy and 66Gy/33f radiotherapy and achieved a partial response (PR). The patient experienced recurrent hemoptysis in March 2021. He was in poor condition, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score of 2. A chest CT showed a 7.3 cm mass in the lower right hilum, an enlarged 6.8 cm lymph node in the left axillary, and pleural effusion on the right side. Serum tumor marker levels, including carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragments, and neuron-specific enolase, were high. We recommended immunotherapy with nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg, once every two weeks from 3rd of May 2021 and thoracic perfusion treatment with recombinant endostatin. Pleural effusion was well controlled after four cycles of nivolumab and endostar, but the tumor continued to progress. The patient's condition deteriorated further, to an ECOG PS score of 3. At this time, DNA profiling was introduced, but no mutations in known driver genes (EGFR, ALK, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, RET, ROS1, and KRAS) were identified. This profiling also showed that the patient had a high tumor mutation burden. Nivolumab plus nab-paclitaxel were administered. Two cycles of therapy led to a PR in his tumor, sharply decreased tumor markers, and an improved ECOG PS score of 1. Another two cycles were implemented and the lesion shrank further. Nivolumab therapy was maintained and the patient was regularly followed-up. The response was stable up to January 2022.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What is the patient\u2019s most recent ECOG score relative to the date of the clinical note?

CT-guided left lower lobe biopsy confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and hotspot polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing identified an activating EGFR L858R mutation but no EGFR T790M. 20 days after diagnosis was established, the patient begun on erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily. She achieved a good partial response and symptomatic improvement lasting 13 months, at which time a new left lower lobe lesion 1.8 \u00d7 1.3 cm as well as increased activity in her known bony disease was seen. A biopsy of the right pelvic mass was performed and was consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Additional hotspot molecular testing post-erlotinib confirmed the EGFR L858R mutation and was negative for EGFR T790M. However, a single-gene droplet-digital PCR test from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) performed after progression on erlotinib identified EGFR T790M, and the patient was transitioned to osimertinib in October 2020. She had symptomatic improvement and partial response lasting 12 months, at which point a new left pelvic mass with bony involvement was identified. A left pelvic mass core biopsy from the soft tissue component was subjected to comprehensive genomic profiling (FoundationOne\u00ae, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA), which identified the original EGFR L858R at a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 50.52%, an EGFR T790M at 37.14%, an EGFR G796S at 38.69%, EGFR amplification at 16 predicted copies, and a low mutational burden (four mutations per DNA megabase). Overlapping sequencing reads spanning the T790M and G796S confirmed cis orientation (). A concurrent ctDNA assay (FoundationACT\u2122, Foundation Medicine) detected the EGFR L858R (MAF 12.8%), EGFR T790M (MAF 11.2%), and the G796S (MAF 11.6%) without other putative resistance alterations. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high PD-L1 expression at 70% by tumor proportion score (Dako 22C3 pharmDx, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Additional genomic alterations are shown in , and no other putative drivers were detected. In the absence of available trials, she was transitioned to carboplatin plus pemetrexed and achieved stable disease after three cycles followed by disease progression. Based on lack of standard therapies and high PD-L1 expression that patient was then enrolled in a clinical trial of pembrolizumab in combination with the oral IDO-1 inhibitor epacadostat (NCT02178722). She has achieved a radiographic partial response and remains on therapy, now 5 months in duration. The patient has provided written informed consent to have the case details and any accompanying images published.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with lung cancer?

After her most recent treatment, she developed generalized urticaria, lip angioedema, numbness on her face, abdominal pain, vomiting, chest tightness, and hypotension 2 minutes after injection. Lidocaine hypersensitivity was suspected. She decided to stop the treatment, without any medication being prescribed for her condition. She was healthy, with no history of any other medication use and no history of drug/food allergy or atopic diseases. After 1 year she returned for intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide only (without lidocaine), and was scheduled once a month for this regimen. The first injection was tolerated well. The reaction occurred at the time of the second injection, with numbness on her face developing 15 minutes after injection and 5 minutes later with urticaria on her chest wall and both arms, together with hypotension (blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg). At the emergency room, her vital signs revealed blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, temperature 37.2\u2103, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Immediate treatment with an intramuscular injection of adrenaline, intravenous dexamethasone and chlorpheniramine was given, and the patient quickly recovered. Laboratory investigation showed white blood cells 13.7\u00d7109/L (neutrophils 86%, lymphocytes 11%, monocytes 2%, eosinophils 1%) and serum tryptase 5.89 ng/mL (1.9\u201313.5 ng/mL). Anaphylaxis was diagnosed. The allergology workup was performed 4 weeks after the anaphylaxis event to clarify the identity of the culprit drug. Skin tests with triamcinolone acetonide, lidocaine, and the excipients carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), benzyl alcohol and polysorbate 80, were performed, together with alternative corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). The skin test concentrations were as previously reported  and are summarized in . Histamine and normal saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The skin prick test (SPT) was considered positive when a wheal of more than 3 mm in diameter presented after 15 minutes. If the SPT was negative, an intradermal test (IDT) was performed by injecting 0.02\u20130.05 mL of the reagent solution intradermally. Results were interpreted after 20 minutes, and a positive result was declared when the wheal and erythema extended more than 2 mm from the initial injection papule. When SPT and IDT were negative, a provocation test was performed. The patient had a positive SPT for triamcinolone acetonide, which confirmed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. The SPT for the other corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone, were negative. Subcutaneous provocation with lidocaine (cumulative dose of 3.2 mL of 1% lidocaine) and oral CMC (cumulative dose of 250 mg) was well-tolerated and considered negative.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever presented hypersensitivity reaction to triamcinolone acetonide?

His other comorbidities included atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, obstructive sleep apnea, and a remote history of pulmonary embolism. He denied any known family history of breast or other types of cancer.\nOn examination of the left breast, the area was non-erythematous with a palpable 1.5 cm firm, circular, painless mass in the left lower quadrant, subareolar region. The patient had a mammogram on July 2 showing a 1.8 cm x 1.8 cm x 1.5 cm left subareolar lobulated mass highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 5). Left breast ultrasound showed a hypoechoic vascular mass with microlobular margins of similar size. Left axillary lymph nodes and right breast appeared normal at the time of imaging. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan for initial cancer screening was performed with no signs of nodal or distant metastasis. Needle core biopsy of the mass was performed and showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) Grade 1 (mitotic rate: score 1, pleomorphism: score 2, tubules: score 3, total score: 5). Immunohistochemical results were estrogen receptor (ER) positive (>90%), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (>90%), HER2/Neu 2+ equivocal with no amplification on fluorescence in situ hybrid (FISH), and E-Cadherin positive within tumor cells. The patient tested negative for mutations in the genes BRCA 1 and 2, TP53, PTEN, and PALB2.\nThe patient underwent a left modified radical mastectomy on July 10 and a 1.7 x 1.5 cm solid, pale pink, well circumscribed mass was found subjacent to the nipple with a 0.4 cm central area of hemorrhage. Eight lymph nodes were dissected with one positive for metastatic carcinoma with three metastatic foci in the node. The largest focus measured 0.3 cm and was HER2 negative. Microscopic evaluation determined the patient to have invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the left breast and pathologic staging was evaluated at PT1c N1a Mx. Oncotype DX for breast recurrence was four, distance recurrence risk at nine years at 3%, and no apparent benefit of chemotherapy. After discussing the treatment options at length, the patient opted for surveillance with annual mammograms and no adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) What is this patient's Oncotype DX Recurrence Score?

Family history of\nbreast cancer in patient's mother at 44. Annual mammogram.\nFINDINGS: A wire was placed over the upper-outer right breast indicating the\nlumpectomy scar and routine views of both breasts were performed using digital\nmammography interpreted with computer-aided detection. The MLO views are\nsuboptimal due to inability of the patient to tolerate the positioning\nrequirements for these views due to her medical condition. Comparison made\nwith 2020-6-4, 2019-5-24, and film exam from 2018-3-23.\nBoth breasts demonstrate a heterogeneously dense glandular pattern. In the\nmedial right breast at mid/posterior depth, there are loosely associated\npunctate calcifications which are seen within a patch of glandular tissue\nmedially. These are likely benign; however, the patient refuses additional\nmagnification views. Six-month followup is recommended. Otherwise, no\ndominant mass or significant architectural distortion.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Suboptimal exam due to patient positioning and inability to cooperate for\nadditional views due to her medical condition.

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.\nHer physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient\u2019s baseline.

A pancreaticoduodenectomy surgery (Whipple) for definitive treatment was offered to the patient. The patient was reluctant to undergo major surgery and opted for systemic treatment instead. He presented to the ER two months after starting chemotherapy, on March 20, with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) (vomiting, belching, and weight loss). An attempt was made to manage the GOO non-operatively per the patient's wishes with duodenal stenting.\nA self-expanding, 22 mm x 9 cm fully covered, metal stent was placed into the second portion of the duodenum where a large, partially obstructing, ulcerated mass was visualized endoscopically.\nSeveral hours after the procedure, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed that the stent placement resulted in a perforation of the duodenum with extension into the retroperitoneum.\nEmergency pancreaticoduodenectomy versus damage control surgery were the two surgical options offered to the patient. The patient opted for damage control surgery. He was taken emergently for an exploratory laparotomy, washout of the abdomen, wide drainage, duodenostomy tube placement, and pyloric exclusion.\nHis postoperative course was uneventful, and he recovered quickly. After four months of healing, the patient underwent a definitive pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure. Final pathology revealed a mixed adeno-neuroendocrine carcinoma, arising from the duodenum/peri-ampullary area and invading into the pancreas and duodenal serosa (pT3, pN1, cM1) with 3 of 16 lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma and all margins negative. He went on to receive adjuvant systemic treatment and continues to do well postoperatively.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Was this patient ever diagnosed with cancer of the duodenum?

He underwent a debulking left nephrectomy with Dr. Smith on 2019-8-25, and was diagnosed with metastatic kidney cancer by thyroidectomy in 2019-7-5. This revealed high grade renal cell carcinoma that was metastatic to the adrenal gland. Following debulking nephrectomy, he was found to be presented with severe bone pain. Location of his pain was in the right shoulder. Given that the pain did not resolve, he underwent a MRI which showed ultimately a lytic lesion in the right shoulder and was treated with radiation therapy to the shoulder as well as ultimately undergoing treatment with chemotherapy. He did not respond to chemotherapy and developed a large lytic lesion in the left femur requiring an operative embolization and rod placement in 02/2020. Following that, he had multiple radiation therapies to the spine as well as right scapula as well as left femur. He was seen on multiple occasions over the last several weeks complaining of increasing pain in the right shoulder. CT scan revealed a large lytic lesion. Given that this area had been radiated twice, tentatively booked to see Dr. Polinsky in Radiology for radiofrequency ablation for pain relief. He has been on OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Morphine elixir for breakthrough pain, and he has been a little better over the last few days.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does this patient have bone pain?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"he was found to be presented with severe bone pain\",\n\"the pain did not resolve\", and \"He was seen on multiple occasions over the last\nseveral weeks complaining of increasing pain in the right shoulder\".

He was an ex-smoker with a 45 pack-year history and had tuberculosis 25 years ago. Two years prior, the patient presented with a low back pain and anal incontinence. The tumor appeared to replace most of the prostate and spread to perirectal area and bilateral pelvic wall on computed tomography (CT) (). Extensive pelvic lymphadenopathy and bone metastasis of the 11th thoracic vertebra were also found. He underwent a palliative transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and was diagnosed with prostate cancer of Gleason score 9 (4 + 5) on pathologic examination. He started receiving radiation therapy while taking leuprorelin, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels dropped from 78.54 to 0.2 ng/mL and the androgen levels reached within castration concentrations (testosterone 0.13 ng/dL, free testosterone 0.58 ng/dL) for a year. On chest radiographs, bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate amount were observed (), with a larger amount on the right side (). No mass-like lesion was found on thoracic CT scan. Bone scans showed newly noted multifocal uptakes in skull, rib cage, sacrum, pelvic bones, humeri, and femurs. For reliable diagnosis and appropriate management, ultrasound-guided percutaneous pigtail catheters were inserted. The drained pleural fluid was turbid yellow with glucose 94 mg/dL, protein 4.4 g/dL, triglyceride 13 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 1,113 U/L, and adenosine deaminase 17.1 IU/L. Its differential count was 7% lymphocytes, 41% macrophages, 5% mesothelial cells, and 47% malignant cells. PSA in pleural fluid and concomitant serum PSA were 21.50 and 44.71 ng/mL respectively. The pleural fluid was prepared with routine conventional smear. The Papanicolaou stained smears showed groups of neoplastic cells arranged in large cell-clusters (). Most of them formed large three-dimensional balls without glandular lumen (), and they consisted of medium sized round to ovoid cells showing coarse, finely granular and vesicular chromatin. Most tumor cells showed smooth nuclear contours with large prominent nucleoli, but some showed irregular nuclear borders. They had hyperchromatic nuclei with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio (). Nuclear pleomorphism was minimal to mild and mitosis was hardly found (less than 1/10 high-power field). The architectural and cytologic features were mostly similar on cell block, but a few glandular lumens were found. The tumor cells were in tightly cohesive groups without lumen (). A very few of them had glandular lumen-like space with central necrosis (). They had pale eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm, and the amount of cytoplasm was small to moderate. Based on these findings, the tumor cells were taken to be poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown origin. Immunocytochemical panel studies were performed on the cell block to determine the origin of cancer metastasis. The tumor cells were immunopositive for PSA (), alpha-methylacylcoenzyme A racemase (AMACR) (), and Nkx 3.1 (). They showed negative immunoreactivity for P40, cytokeratin 5/6 (), thyroid transcription factor-1 and gross cystic disease fluid protein. The patient was finally diagnosed with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. He was then treated with a second-line chemotherapeutic agent, biweekly docetaxel and oral dexamethasone. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital (KC17ZESI0451) and was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The computed tomography imaging detected lamellar calcification of the falx cerebri, which is a pathognomonic feature of GGS (fig. ) []. Meeting the criteria for GGS and considering the pathognomonic feature of the lamellar calcification (major criterion for GGS), the patient was referred to the Department of Dermatology. An examination of the patient's skin showed multiple small lesions clinically resembling basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) on the back, for which shave excisions were carried out. One suspected nodular BCC on the nose was removed by Mohs micrographic surgery. Pathologic examination of the lesions revealed 9 superficial BCCs on the back and 1 nodular BCC on the nose. The patient reported that the first BCC had occurred at the age of 27 years, and subsequently 4 other superficial BCCs had been removed by shave excision until the diagnosis of GGS was established. Furthermore, the patient presented with multiple palmar pits and marked syndactyly of the toes. Therefore, in our case, 2 major criteria [(I) lamellar calcification of falx cerebri, and (II) more than 2 BCCs] and 1 minor criterion (marked syndactyly of digits) were detected []. Additionally, the diagnosis of GGS was confirmed by positive testing for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH. Taking into account that GGS is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with nearly full penetrance and variable expressivity [], the daughters of our patient were screened for PTCH gene mutations as well. Although they both had no BCCs upon clinical inspection and none recorded in their medical history, one of the daughters tested positive for a PTCH gene mutation.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does this patient have at least two BCC tumors?

Colonoscopy revealed a mass in rectum, and preoperative pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma. On July, 2018, the loop sigmoid colostomy was performed, which revealed about 300 mL bloody ascites in pelvis. A 9\u00d78\u00d76 cm mass was found in segment IV of liver, and some pale nodules were distributed in the abdominal cavity and right ovary, which were diagnosed as pelvic mucinous adenocarcinoma planting metastasis (by intraoperative frozen section examination). The diagnosis was rectal adenocarcinoma with diffused pelvic and liver metastasis (T4N2M1 stage IV). No gene mutations were detected in RAS and BRAF. Because our department was conducting clinical research comparing the efficacy of raltitrexed versus fluoropyrimidine in treating mCRC at that time when the patient was admitted to our hospital, we enrolled the patient in our research and administered the patient \u201coxaliplatin + raltitrexed\u201d for three cycles (Jul 2018 to Sep 2018). Unfortunately, her follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans indicated progressive disease (PD). Concerning the patient\u2019s poor response, and severe gastrointestinal symptoms, we recommended the patient use S-1, which is an oral 5-FU prodrug that has slight gastrointestinal toxicity. Her treatment was then altered for three cycles of \u201coxaliplatin + S-1\u201d regimen, as the second-line chemotherapy (Oct 2018\u2013Dec 2018). The therapeutic evaluation was stable disease (SD). Then, she was administered S-1 orally as a maintenance treatment for six cycles (Jan 2015 to Jun 2015) until the patient obtained PD on CT scans. The patient\u2019s condition deteriorated with increased ascites and aggravated gastrointestinal symptoms. Afterward, \u201cCisplatin + Endostatin\u201d hyperthermia peritoneal perfusion chemotherapy was applied three times to treat massive ascites in Jul 2018. The patient obtained PD on CT scans after the termination of chemotherapy. Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) and regorafenib were not approved in China at that time, and there were no suitable clinical trials of mCRC in our hospital. The patient refused to consult in other hospitals or purchase expensive targeted agents. Apatinib went on the market at that time with a favorable policy for purchasing. After signing informed consent, the patient started taking apatinib (850 mg/day) in Oct 2019. Because of the side effects of hand\u2013foot syndrome (HFS) (grade 2) and proteinuria (grade 2), the patient had a short-time drug withdrawal, and recovered from the side effects with symptomatic treatment during apatinib treatment. Four months later, the follow-up CT scan indicated an SD by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) with a 22.2% decrease of liver target lesions compared with the baseline of Oct 2015. However, due to severe abdominal distension and loss of appetite, we had to terminate the use of apatinib, and we gave the patient immediate and appropriate care in Mar 2020.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with mCRC?

The pain was located mainly over the lateral knee and was noted when she bore weight on her right lower limb, such as standing up from bed in the morning, standing for more than 30 minutes for housework, walking, and stair climbing. There was occasional right knee swelling if she walked for a long distance. No resting pain or nocturnal pain was complained. Osteoarthritis of the right knee joint (Kellgren and Lawrence classification grade III) was diagnosed at another clinic. The pain worsened three months before her visit, and she failed to improve with the conservative treatment, including three courses of physical therapy with physical modality and exercise, and acupuncture three times weekly for two months. The visual analog scale (VAS) was 7-8/10 and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were 16/20 for pain, 4/8 for stiffness, 51/68 for physical disability. On physical examination, she had an antalgic gait and a slight reduction of range of motion of the right knee compared to the left (right 5-110 degrees and left 0-120 degrees). There was severe tenderness (VAS 7-8/10) over the lateral part of the tibial plateau, which in fact reproduced the patient\u2019s usual pain when she stepped down on the floor each morning. McMurray test was positive over both the medial and lateral menisci. The US examination revealed signs of lateral and medial meniscus tears with marginal osteophytes and a cortical break over the lateral tibial plateau close to the Gerdy\u2019s tubercle (Figure ). The MRI revealed a general osteoarthritic change and tears of the lateral and medial menisci, and there was a subchondral BML over the lateral tibial plateau (Figure ). After a discussion about the treatment, the patient opted for regenerative injection therapy. We performed a US-assisted intraosseous injection of PRP (Smart Prep II; Harvest Technologies, Belton, TX, USA; 60ml whole blood to 6ml PRP) at the subchondral BML of the lateral tibial plateau by placing a 21-gauge, 1.5-inch needle through the cortical break close to the Gerdy\u2019s tubercle (Figure , Video ). After evaluating the orientation of the opening of the cortical break, the needle was inserted into the apex of the hole and further advanced deeper to the subchondral bone. The contrast (Ominpaque 350) was then injected under fluoroscopy to confirm the needle placement and evaluate the contrast spread (Figure ). The contrast reached the location of the subchondral bone marrow lesion at the lateral tibial plateau and the injection did reproduce the patient\u2019s usual knee pain on weight-bearing. PRP injection (3ml) was then offered to the same region and the displacement of the contrast was observed under fluoroscopy. The patient was kept to have non-weight-bearing to her right knee for two days and when she was allowed to have full-weight bearing walking on the third day, she reported VAS 3/10. Three weeks later, the patient reported significant improvement of her pain with VAS 0-2/10. She could walk 1.5 to two hours over level ground and stand more than 1.5 hours without pain. The WOMAC scores were 4/20 for pain, 0/8 for stiffness, 12/68 for physical disability. The MRI six months after the treatment revealed resolution of the subchondral BML (Figure ).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Does the patient have a knee osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence grade of 3?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"Osteoarthritis of the right knee joint (Kellgren and Lawrence classification grade III) was diagnosed\".

After diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer (cT4N1M1b) with Gleason score 7 (4 + 3), he was started on combined androgen blockade (CAB) with degarelix and bicalutamide in January 2018. For local control, he underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the prostate (66 Gy/33 fractions). Although the patient initially responded well to treatment (PSA nadir of 0.039 ng/mL), he was diagnosed with CRPC when we found that his PSA levels had increased 9 months after starting CAB. Abiraterone and prednisolone were administered and resulted in a 50% reduction of PSA. However, despite the reduction of PSA, the disease progressed. He had frequent repeated episodes of severe anemia, and bone marrow aspiration showed a bone marrow metastasis. In April 2019, the patient presented with a severe headache and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain metastases with major lesions in the left middle cranial fossa. We administered mannitol, furosemide, and dexamethasone to reduce intracranial pressure and subsequently started WBRT. However, the patient wanted to stop WBRT (the total radiation dose was 9 Gy/3 fractions) and died 1 month after diagnosis of his brain metastasis.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient ever received colchicine?

He initially was found to have high-risk prostate cancer (iPSA 9.9, GS 4+4=8, cT2a) in late 2012, s/p cryoablation to a palpable and radiographically visible focus in the right midgland. He had an intermediate PSA response, with recent rise in PSA from nadir to 3.77 in March 2015 to 8.8 currently. The C-11 acetate PET/CT did show a metabolically active focus in the left apex of the prostate; he did have a biopsy of a left base lesion in 2014 that showed fibrous tissue.\r\nMedication\r\n\u2022\tamlodipine (NORVASC) 5 mg tablet by mouth.\r\n\u2022\teszopiclone (LUNESTA) 2 mg tablet by mouth.\r\n\u2022\thydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablet\t \r\n\u2022\tsimvastatin 20 mg tablet\t \r\n\u2022\tazithromycin 250 mg tablet\t \r\n\u2022\tlevofloxacin 500 mg tablet\t \r\n\u2022\tVIAGRA 100 MG tablet\t \r\nPlan/ Recommendation:\r\nWe reviewed the patient\u2019s detailed clinical history and imaging. His original pathology reports are not available for review, both multiple outside record notes mention a prior biopsy showing Gleason 8 disease.\r\nThe C11 acetate and 18NaF PET/CT scans are reasonably specific and sensitive, and with evidence of new lesions concordant with a rising PSA and no definitive treatment for his original primary disease (i.e., partial cryo alone in 2012), all available evidence suggests that he has oligometastatic disease. The patient would like to think more about systemic therapy options (specifically, he is interested in triple therapy with Lupron, Zytiga, and Taxotere).\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient been diagnosed with prostate cancer?

Laboratory data at the time showed that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 18.6 ng/mL, and digital rectal examination indicated a stony hard mass in the prostate that was suspected to be local advanced prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a prostate tumor invading the seminal vesicle and a metastasis of the pubic bone. Based on these results, the patient underwent neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and docetaxel therapy, followed by laparoscopic prostatectomy, extended lymphadenenolectomy, and metastatectomy of the pubic bone in March 2014. Pathological examination revealed residual adenocarcinoma in the prostate and pubic bone (pathological T stage 3b, positive surgical margin). After the operation, he received adjuvant radiation therapy (66 Gy) to the pelvic floor. His serum PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL but gradually increased to 0.14 ng/mL. He was then re-initiated on docetaxel in December 2015, although computed tomography (CT) and bone scan did not show obvious metastatic lesions. His PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL in April 2016 after 7 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy but slightly increased to 0.17 ng/mL in July 2016. Positron emission tomography-CT indicated five tiny nodules in the bilateral lungs. Biopsy specimens are difficult to obtain and might not reflect the precise extent of the disease owing to heterogeneity in patients with CRPC. Therefore, we performed liquid biopsy to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the ClearCell FX System, which is an automated CTC enrichment system that is powered by a microfluidics biochip. To count the CTCs isolated using this system, we performed immunostaining using the following antibodies: mouse anti-pan human keratin (C11) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (keratin 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), mouse anti-human cytokeratin mAb (CK3-6H5, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), mouse anti-human EpCAM (VU1D9) mAb (Cell Signaling), goat N-terminal androgen receptor (AR; N-10) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and rabbit CD45 (D9M81) mAb (Cell Signaling). Additionally, we performed nuclear staining using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Overall, 156 CTCs were detected per 7.5 mL, and almost all CTCs were AR negative in the nucleus. Therefore, we diagnosed the five tiny nodules as lung metastases from docetaxel-resistant CRPC with few AR-signaling-dependent cancer cells.\nThe patient was initiated on CBZ (25 mg/m2) according to the standard protocol in August 2016, instead of a second-generation AR-targeting agent (enzalutamide or abiraterone). Following 2 cycles of CBZ chemotherapy, the PSA level decreased to < 0.01 ng/mL and the lung metastases completely disappeared, with a reduced CTC count of < 5. To date, the patient has been receiving intermittent CBZ chemotherapy.\n</ClinicalNote>\nQuestions: (1) Has the patient received androgen deprivation therapy? (2) If so, when did such therapy start?\n\n### Response:", "completion": "(1) The clinical note says \"the patient underwent neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and docetaxel therapy\".

On chest x-ray, she had a possible infiltrate and it was thought she might have pneumonia and she was treated with antibiotics and prednisone. Symptoms improved temporarily, but did not completely resolve. By the end of September, her pain had worsened and she was seen in the emergency room at Beth Israel. Chest x-ray was compatible with pleurisy and she was treated with Percocet. Few days later, she was seen and given a prescription for Ultram because Percocet was causing nausea. Eventually, she was seen by Dr. Ng and noted to have splenomegaly. Repeat ultrasound was done and showed the spleen enlarged at 19 cm. In retrospect, this was not changed in comparison to an ultrasound that was done in September. She underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which showed diffuse hypermetabolic lymph nodes measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter, as well as a hypermetabolic spleen that was enlarged.,The patient underwent lymph node biopsy on the right neck on 10/27/2016. Pathology is consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.,On 10/31/2016, she had a bone marrow biopsy. This does show involvement of bone marrow with lymphoma.,She was noted to have circulating lymphoma cells on peripheral smear as well.,Although CBC was normal, MCV was low and the ferritin was assessed and was low at 8, consistent with iron deficiency.,ALLERGIES:, NONE.,MEDICATIONS: ,1. Estradiol/Prometrium. ,2. Ultram p.r.n. ,3. Baby aspirin. ,4. Lunesta for sleep. ,5. She has been started on iron supplements.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ,1. Tubal ligation in 1996.,2. Possible cyst removed from the left neck in 2001.,3. Tonsillectomy.,4. Migraines, which are rare.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes and drinks alcohol only occasionally. She is married and has two children, ages 24 and 20. She works as a project administrator.,FAMILY HISTORY: ,Father is deceased. He had emphysema and colon cancer at age 68.
